## Değirmen (The Mill)

**Turkish:**  
*Dünya döner bir değirmen. Aşk olsun çevirene. Allah'ından korkmazsan taş olursun.*

**English:**  
The world turns like a mill. Blessings to the one who turns it. If you do not fear your God, you become stone.

**Meaning:**  
The world is a mill that keeps turning. Honor and love to the one who turns it—who does the work, who keeps the wheel moving. Without fear of God, the heart turns to stone: hardness instead of feeling, rigidity instead of flow. Aligns with Duygu Adamı (emotion-first), the Table and the Covenant, and heart-first in all channels.

## One Love

**One Love.** Obvious. Peace, love, unity. Energy + Love = We all win. Embedded in the Table and the Covenant and in every channel.
