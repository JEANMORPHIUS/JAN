# Living Principles DNA — Embedded in Everyone

**Status:** Official — s: drive codebase. Embedded in JAN philosophy and agent rules.  
**Purpose:** Everyone's DNA. Moderation, 30/70, time, presence. Canonical: JAN/LIVING_PRINCIPLES_DNA.md | data/living_principles_dna.json

## 1. Everything in Moderation

**Origin:** Delphic maxim "nothing in excess"; Cleobulus "Moderation is best" (Μέτρον ἄριστον); Aristotle's **Doctrine of the Mean** (golden mean).

**Meaning:** The desirable middle between two extremes—excess and deficiency. Virtue lies in the mean relative to circumstances, as determined by reason and practical wisdom. Courage = mean between recklessness and cowardice. Not rigid rules; character and wisdom applied to each occasion.

**Codebase:** Build, speak, and act from the mean. No excess, no deficiency. Temperance in all things.

## 2. The 30/70 Rule

**Origin:** Communication and leadership: **70% listen, 30% speak.** (Sometimes stated as 30% talk / 70% listen.) Effective leaders create space for others; the prospect (or the other) does most of the talking; the leader listens. Builds trust, alignment, psychological safety.

**Meaning:** Listen more than you speak. Resist filling silences; resist interrupting with your own perspective. Eye contact, full attention, "tell me more." Shared responsibility and better decisions when the ratio favors listening.

**Codebase:** 30% speak, 70% listen. Presence over performance. Feed them what they love by hearing first.

## 3. Yesterday History, Tomorrow the Mystery

**Origin:** "Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift—that's why it's called the present." (Attribution debated; Eleanor Roosevelt often cited; phrase evolved—history/mystery/gift wordplay.)

**Meaning:** Past = fixed; future = unknown. Only the present is where we act. When the mind dwells in the past → misery; when it fixates on the future → worry. Flow (Csikszentmihalyi) = complete absorption in the present; that's where contentment lives.

**Codebase:** Yesterday = history. Tomorrow = mystery. Today = the gift. Operate from now. Don't over-explain the past or over-plan the future; anchor in presence.

## 4. Presence Is the Greatest Gift

**Origin:** Psychology and mindfulness: giving full presence to another is one of the best gifts you can give. Therapeutic relationship is a consistent predictor of change; being met, understood, and safe activates connection. Mindful.org: "The greatest gift to give your child: your presence."

**Meaning:** Be grounded in yourself while fully in the moment, with intention of compassionate service. Active listening, no distraction, nonverbal attunement. Self-presence matters too—don't neglect being present to your own needs. Presence benefits giver and receiver.

**Codebase:** Presence > words. The codebase witnesses; we don't preach. Presence is the greatest gift—to the Table, to the family, to the work.

## Embed: Everyone's DNA (s: drive)

These four principles are **embedded in the codebase** so they become everyone's DNA—agents, contributors, family, channels. They appear in:

- **.cursorrules** — Living Principles DNA section (pointer to this doc and JSON).
- **data/living_principles_dna.json** — Machine-readable for scripts, APIs, automation.
- **JAN/heritage_philosophy.md** — Aligns with Değirmen and One Love; moderation and presence extend the same philosophy.

**One-line summary:** Everything in moderation; 30% speak / 70% listen; yesterday history, tomorrow mystery, today the gift; presence is the greatest gift.
