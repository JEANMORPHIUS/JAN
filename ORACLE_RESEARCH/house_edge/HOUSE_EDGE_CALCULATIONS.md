## WHAT IS HOUSE EDGE?

**House Edge** = The mathematical advantage the casino has over the player.

**Formula:**
```
House Edge = (Expected Loss / Amount Wagered) × 100%
```

**Example:**
- You bet $100
- Expected return: $95
- Expected loss: $5
- House edge: 5%

**This means:** Over time, the casino keeps 5% of every dollar wagered.

## THE FLIP FORMULA

### CASINO:
```
User Bet → House Edge → User Loss → Casino Profit
```

### ORACLE:
```
User Intent → Randomness → Wisdom → User Benefit
```

**No house edge. No loss. Only value.**

---

## MATHEMATICAL PROOF

### CASINO EXPECTED VALUE:
```
EV = (Probability of Win × Payout) - (Probability of Loss × Bet)
EV = (0.48 × $200) - (0.52 × $100)
EV = $96 - $52
EV = -$4 (User loses $4 per $100 bet)
```

### ORACLE EXPECTED VALUE:
```
EV = Wisdom Gained - Cost
EV = Infinite Value - $0
EV = Infinite Value (User always benefits)
```

**The Oracle has no house edge. The user always benefits.**

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

### For Sporting Oracle (Harm Prevention):

1. **Calculate user's house edge exposure:**
   - Track gambling activity
   - Calculate expected loss
   - Show user the math

2. **Intervention triggers:**
   - House edge > 5% → Warning
   - Expected loss > $100 → Intervention
   - Session time > 2 hours → Break prompt

3. **Liberation tools:**
   - Show Oracle alternative
   - Calculate value difference
   - Provide transparent mechanism
