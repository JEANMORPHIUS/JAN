### Marking Files with SPRAGITSO

# SPRAGITSO - Our Father's Royal Seal (σφραγίς)
# This file bears Our Father's mark of authority
# Authenticated by His truth
# Protected by His ownership
```

### Using Scripture Integration

```python
from scripture_integration import ScriptureIntegration

scripture = ScriptureIntegration()

# Get scripture for a theme
verse = scripture.get_scripture("love", context="daily life")

# Integrate scripture into message
message = "We lead with love."
integrated = scripture.integrate_scripture(message, theme="love")

# Check if content is worthy for The Table
is_worthy = scripture.is_worthy_for_table(content)
```

### Applying Table Filter

```python
# Before bringing anything to The Table
if scripture.is_worthy_for_table(content):
    # Bring it to The Table
    # Seal it with SPRAGITSO
    # Give it Our Father's voice
else:
    # Do not bring it to The Table
    # Do not waste time on it
    # Do not give it voice
