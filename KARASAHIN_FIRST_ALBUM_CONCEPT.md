## 🎵 ALBUM CONCEPT

**"YAZILI"** (Written/Destiny) is Karasahin's debut album—a journey through mirrors, masks, and truth. The album tells the story of self-discovery, from the darkness of questioning identity to the light of love and resilience. It's **3 AM music** for the soul, where Turkish Arabesque meets R&B, where Folk-Rock meets Pop, where the self becomes a river cutting through stone.

**Core Philosophy:** "Sound is everything. Everything is sound."
