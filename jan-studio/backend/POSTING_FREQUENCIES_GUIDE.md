## Customization Examples

### Override All Entities
```python
# All entities post 3 times per week
schedule = generate_2026_scripture_schedule(posts_per_week=3)
```

### Override Specific Entities
```python
# Jean posts 5x/week, others use defaults
schedule = generate_2026_scripture_schedule(
    entity_frequencies={
        'jean_mahram': 5,
        'uncle_ray_ramiz': 1  # Contemplative - less frequent
    }
)
```

### Season-Based Adjustments
```python
# Higher frequency during launch periods
launch_frequencies = {
    'edible_london': 4,  # Launch period
    'ilven_seamoss': 4,  # Launch period
    'jean_mahram': 5,    # Peak creative season
}

schedule = generate_2026_scripture_schedule(
    entity_frequencies=launch_frequencies
)
```
