Dear Parents and Guardians,

We're excited to introduce a new creative technology program in our classroom! This semester, students will be learning about AI and creativity using JAN Studio, a kid-friendly tool that runs on a Raspberry Pi computer.

**What is JAN Studio?**
JAN Studio is a tool that helps students create "personas" - like giving a computer a character to play - and then use those personas to generate creative content like stories, poems, and explanations.

**What will students learn?**
- How AI can be used creatively and responsibly
- How to write clear instructions for AI
- How to create and refine creative projects
- Digital literacy and critical thinking skills

**Is it safe?**
Yes! JAN Studio:
- Runs entirely on a local computer (no internet required)
- All content is filtered for age-appropriateness
- No personal data is collected or shared
- Students' work stays private

**How can you help?**
- Ask your child about what they're creating
- Encourage them to share their work with you
- Discuss responsible AI use at home

**Questions?**
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
