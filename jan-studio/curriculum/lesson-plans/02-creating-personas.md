- "What didn't work as expected?"

**Share Examples:**
- Show 2-3 student personas from last lesson
- Discuss what made them good

### Part 2: Persona Building Blocks (15 minutes)

**Activity: "What Makes a Good Persona?"**

**Component 1: Identity (5 minutes)**

### Part 3: Comparison Activity (10 minutes)

**Activity: "Basic vs. Detailed"**

Show two versions of the same persona:

**Basic Version:**
```
Name: Storyteller
Description: Writes stories
```

**Detailed Version:**
```
Name: The Adventure Storyteller
Role: Creative writer specializing in adventure stories
Description: Creates exciting adventure stories with brave heroes, 
mysterious quests, and happy endings. Uses vivid descriptions and 
engaging dialogue. Stories are appropriate for ages 10-16.
Rules:
- Always include a clear beginning, middle, and end
- Create characters that are brave and kind
- Use descriptive language to paint pictures
- Keep stories positive and inspiring
- Never include violence or scary content
```

**Discussion:**
- "Which version would work better? Why?"
- "What details make the second version better?"
- "How do rules help the AI?"

**Key Takeaway:**
- More detail = better results
- Rules guide the AI's behavior
- Specific descriptions create better personas

### Part 4: Improve Your Persona (15 minutes)

**Activity: "Persona Makeover"**

**Step 1: Review Your First Persona (3 minutes)**
- Look at the persona you created last lesson
- Identify what's missing
- Note what could be improved

**Step 2: Add Details (5 minutes)**
- Expand the description
- Add specific examples
- Include personality traits

**Step 3: Write Rules (5 minutes)**
- List 3-5 things the persona should do
- List 2-3 things the persona shouldn't do
- Make rules specific and clear

**Step 4: Test the Improved Persona (2 minutes)**
- Generate new content
- Compare to previous output
- Notice improvements

**Checklist:**
- [ ] I added a clear role/purpose
- [ ] I expanded the description with details
- [ ] I wrote at least 3 rules
- [ ] I tested the improved persona
- [ ] The new output is better than before

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment

- **Worksheet completion:** Did students identify all components?
- **Comparison discussion:** Can they explain why detailed is better?
- **Improved persona:** Does it have all required elements?

### Summative Assessment

**Task:** Create an improved persona with:
1. Clear identity (name, role)
2. Detailed description (3+ sentences)
3. At least 3 rules
4. One successful generation

**Rubric:** See `assessment-rubrics/lesson-02-rubric.md`

---

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students

- Provide sentence starters
- Use templates with fill-in-the-blanks
- Focus on one component at a time
- Pair with peer for brainstorming

### For Advanced Students

- Create multiple personas for different purposes
- Write complex rules with exceptions
- Create personas for specific audiences
- Experiment with rule combinations

---

## Extension Activities

1. **Persona Swap:** Exchange personas and improve them
2. **Rule Experiment:** Test what happens when you change rules
3. **Persona Portfolio:** Create a collection of 3 different personas

---

## Homework

**Optional:** Create a second persona for a different purpose (e.g., if you made a storyteller, create an educator).

---

## Teacher Notes

### Common Challenges

- **"I don't know what rules to write"** → Provide examples, brainstorm together
- **"My rules aren't working"** → Rules need to be specific and clear
- **"The output is still not good"** → Personas improve with practice and refinement

### Success Indicators

- Students can identify persona components
- Students write detailed descriptions
- Students create effective rules
- Students see improvement in outputs
