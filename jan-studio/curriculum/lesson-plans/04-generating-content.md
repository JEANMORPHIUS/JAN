## Lesson Structure

### Part 1: What Makes a Good Prompt? (10 minutes)

**Activity: "Prompt Comparison"**

Show students two prompts for the same persona:

**Prompt A (Vague):**
"Write a story"

**Prompt B (Specific):**
"Write a short adventure story about a young explorer who discovers a hidden cave filled with glowing crystals. The story should be exciting but not scary, and have a happy ending."

**Generate content with both prompts and compare:**
- Which one gave better results? Why?
- What details made the second prompt better?
- What can we learn from this?

**Key Concepts:**
- **Specific prompts** create better content
- **Details help** the AI understand what you want
- **Clear instructions** lead to better results

**Discussion:**
- "What information should a good prompt include?"
- "How much detail is too much?"
- "What happens if your prompt is too vague?"

### Part 2: Prompt Building Blocks (15 minutes)

**Activity: "Prompt Recipe"**

**Component 1: What to Create (5 minutes)**
- Be specific about the type of content
- Examples:
  - "Write a short story about..."
  - "Create a poem about..."
  - "Explain how..."

**Component 2: Topic or Subject (5 minutes)**
- What should the content be about?
- Include key details
- Examples:
  - "...a brave knight..."
  - "...how plants grow..."
  - "...a magical forest..."

**Component 3: Requirements (5 minutes)**
- What should the content include or avoid?
- Examples:
  - "...with a happy ending"
  - "...appropriate for kids"
  - "...with at least 3 characters"

**Hands-On Activity:**
Students build a prompt using these components on Worksheet 4.

**Example Prompt Structure:**
```
[What to create] + [Topic/Subject] + [Requirements]
```

**Example:**
"Write a short story about a robot who learns to paint, with a happy ending and at least 2 characters."

### Part 3: Prompt Practice (15 minutes)

**Activity: "Prompt Workshop"**

**Step 1: Write Your First Prompt (5 minutes)**
- Choose a topic you're interested in
- Use the prompt recipe
- Write a specific, detailed prompt

**Step 2: Generate Content (3 minutes)**
- Use your persona
- Generate content with your prompt
- Read the results

**Step 3: Evaluate and Improve (5 minutes)**
- Did you get what you wanted?
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- Rewrite your prompt to make it better

**Step 4: Generate Again (2 minutes)**
- Use your improved prompt
- Compare the new results
- Notice the improvements

**Checklist:**
- [ ] My prompt is specific and clear
- [ ] My prompt includes what to create
- [ ] My prompt includes the topic/subject
- [ ] My prompt includes requirements
- [ ] I generated content and evaluated it
- [ ] I improved my prompt and tried again

### Part 4: Different Types of Prompts (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Prompt Variety"**

Show examples of different prompt types:

**Story Prompts:**
- "Write a story about..."
- "Create a tale where..."
- "Tell a story of..."

**Explanation Prompts:**
- "Explain how..."
- "Describe what..."
- "Teach me about..."

**Creative Prompts:**
- "Write a poem about..."
- "Create lyrics for..."
- "Design a character who..."

**Students try generating one of each type.**

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment

- **Prompt writing:** Are prompts specific and clear?
- **Content generation:** Do students get good results?
- **Prompt improvement:** Can students refine prompts?

### Summative Assessment

**Task:** Create and use effective prompts:
1. Write 3 different prompts (story, explanation, creative)
2. Generate content with each
3. Evaluate and improve at least one prompt
4. Show improvement in results

**Rubric:** See `assessment-rubrics/lesson-04-rubric.md`

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students

- Provide prompt templates
- Use sentence starters
- Focus on one prompt type
- Pair for brainstorming

### For Advanced Students

- Write complex, multi-part prompts
- Experiment with prompt styles
- Create prompts for specific audiences
- Document prompt effectiveness

---

## Extension Activities

1. **Prompt Library:** Create a class library of effective prompts
2. **Prompt Swap:** Try using someone else's prompts
3. **Prompt Evolution:** Track how prompts improve over time

---

## Homework

**Optional:** Write 2 new prompts and generate content at home. Bring your favorite result to share.

---

## Teacher Notes

### Common Challenges

- **"I don't know what to write"** → Provide topic ideas, use examples
- **"My prompt is too long"** → Help students find the right balance
- **"The output isn't what I wanted"** → This is normal! Prompt refinement takes practice

### Success Indicators

- Students write specific, clear prompts
- Students generate content successfully
- Students can evaluate and improve prompts
- Students see improvement with better prompts
