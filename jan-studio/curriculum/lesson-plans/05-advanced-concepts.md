## Lesson Structure

### Part 1: Combining Personas (10 minutes)

**Activity: "Persona Teams"**

**Concept Introduction:**
- Sometimes one persona isn't enough
- Different personas can work together
- Each persona has a specific role

**Example Project: "Create a Story with Music"**
1. Use "Storyteller" persona to write the story
2. Use "Music Producer" persona to create song lyrics
3. Combine them into one project

**Hands-On Activity:**
Students brainstorm a project that uses 2 personas:
- What will each persona do?
- How will they work together?
- What will the final result be?

**Key Takeaway:** Personas can work together like a team.

**Step 4: Generate Again**
- Create improved version
- Compare to original
- Notice improvements

**Hands-On Activity:**
Students refine one piece of content:
1. Generate initial version
2. Identify 2-3 improvements
3. Refine and regenerate
4. Compare results
