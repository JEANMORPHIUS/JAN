## Lesson Structure

### Part 1: Introduction (10 minutes)

**Hook:** Show students an example story generated by a "Storyteller" persona

**Discussion Questions:**
- "What makes this story interesting?"
- "How do you think the computer knew what kind of story to write?"
- "Have you ever given someone instructions on how to write something?"

**Key Concept Introduction:**
- A **persona** is like giving the AI a character to play
- It tells the AI: "You are a storyteller, and here's how you should write"
- Just like actors use scripts, AI uses personas

**Real-World Connection:**
- Authors have writing styles
- Different people write differently
- Personas help AI write in specific ways

---

### Part 2: Guided Exploration (15 minutes)

**Activity: "Meet the Personas"**

Show students 3 example personas:

1. **The Storyteller**
   - Creates stories and characters
   - Example output: Short story

2. **The Music Producer**
   - Creates music prompts and lyrics
   - Example output: Song lyrics

3. **The Educator**
   - Explains things clearly
   - Example output: Lesson explanation

**Discussion:**
- "What's different about each persona?"
- "When would you use each one?"
- "What makes them unique?"

**Key Takeaway:**
- Personas have **purpose** (what they do)
- Personas have **voice** (how they write)
- Personas have **rules** (what they should/shouldn't do)

---

### Part 3: Hands-On Creation (15 minutes)

**Guided Activity: "Create Your First Persona"**

**Step 1: Choose a Purpose (5 minutes)**
- "What do you want your persona to create?"
- Options: Stories, poems, explanations, jokes, etc.
- Students write their choice on Worksheet 1

**Step 2: Describe the Persona (5 minutes)**
- "What should your persona be like?"
- Guide students to think about:
  - Personality (funny, serious, creative)
  - Style (simple, detailed, poetic)
  - Purpose (what they create)

**Step 3: Create in JAN Studio (5 minutes)**
- Demonstrate on projector
- Students follow along on their devices
- Use the kid-friendly interface
- Create persona together

**Checklist for Students:**
- [ ] I chose a purpose for my persona
- [ ] I described what my persona is like
- [ ] I created my persona in JAN Studio
- [ ] I can see my persona in the list

### Part 4: First Generation (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Test Your Persona"**

1. Students write a simple prompt
   - Example: "Write a short story about a robot"
2. Generate content using their persona
3. Share results with partner
4. Discuss: "Did it work as expected?"

**Success Criteria:**
- Persona generates content
- Content matches the persona's purpose
- Student can explain what happened

---

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment (During Lesson)

- **Observation:** Are students engaged?
- **Questions:** Can they explain what a persona is?
- **Checklist:** Did they complete the creation steps?

### Summative Assessment (End of Lesson)

**Assessment Task:** "Create and Test a Persona"

Students must:
1. Create a persona with a clear purpose
2. Generate at least one piece of content
3. Explain why they chose that persona

**Rubric:** See `assessment-rubrics/lesson-01-rubric.md`

---

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students

- Provide persona templates
- Pair with stronger students
- Use voice input instead of typing
- Focus on one simple persona type

### For Advanced Students

- Create multiple personas
- Compare outputs from different personas
- Experiment with persona descriptions
- Create a persona for a specific audience

---

## Extension Activities

1. **Persona Gallery:** Create a class gallery of personas
2. **Persona Swap:** Try using someone else's persona
3. **Persona Evolution:** Improve your persona based on results

---

## Homework

**Optional:** Create a persona at home and bring one generated example to share next class.

---

## Teacher Notes

### Common Issues

- **"I don't know what to create"** → Provide examples and templates
- **"It's not working"** → Check Pi connection, restart if needed
- **"The output is weird"** → This is normal! Personas need refinement

### Success Indicators

- Students can explain what a persona is in their own words
- Students successfully create a persona
- Students generate at least one piece of content
- Students are excited to continue
