## Lesson Structure

### Part 1: Why Rules Matter (10 minutes)

**Activity: "Rules in Real Life"**

**Discussion:**
- "What rules do you follow at school?"
- "Why do we have rules?"
- "What happens when rules are unclear?"

**Connection to Personas:**
- Rules help AI know what to do
- Clear rules = better results
- Unclear rules = confusing outputs

**Example Activity:**
Show two personas with different rules:

**Persona A (Vague Rules):**
- "Write good stories"
- "Be creative"

**Persona B (Specific Rules):**
- "Always start stories with an interesting hook"
- "Include at least one character with a clear goal"
- "End stories with a resolution that makes sense"

**Generate content with both and compare results.**

**Key Takeaway:** Specific rules create better outputs.

### Part 2: Types of Rules (15 minutes)

**Activity: "Rule Categories"**

**Type 1: Must-Do Rules (5 minutes)**
- Things the persona MUST always do
- Examples:
  - "Always use age-appropriate language"
  - "Always include a clear beginning and end"
  - "Always be positive and encouraging"

**Type 2: Must-Not-Do Rules (5 minutes)**
- Things the persona MUST never do
- Examples:
  - "Never use scary or violent content"
  - "Never write about inappropriate topics"
  - "Never use complex words without explanation"

**Type 3: Style Rules (5 minutes)**
- How the persona should write
- Examples:
  - "Use simple, clear sentences"
  - "Include descriptive details"
  - "Write in a friendly, conversational tone"

**Hands-On Activity:**
Students categorize example rules on Worksheet 3.

### Part 3: Writing Effective Rules (15 minutes)

**Activity: "Rule Writing Workshop"**

**Step 1: Brainstorm Rules (5 minutes)**
- Think about what your persona should do
- Think about what your persona shouldn't do
- Think about how your persona should write
- Write down 5-7 ideas

**Step 2: Make Rules Specific (5 minutes)**
- Turn vague ideas into specific rules
- Use action words (always, never, include, avoid)
- Be clear and direct

**Examples of Improvement:**

**Vague:** "Write good stories"
**Specific:** "Write stories with a clear beginning (introduce characters), middle (show a problem), and end (resolve the problem)"

**Vague:** "Be creative"
**Specific:** "Include unexpected plot twists that make sense and surprise the reader"

**Step 3: Test Your Rules (5 minutes)**
- Add rules to your persona
- Generate content
- Check: Did the rules work?
- Adjust if needed

**Checklist:**
- [ ] I have at least 3 must-do rules
- [ ] I have at least 2 must-not-do rules
- [ ] I have at least 2 style rules
- [ ] All rules are specific and clear
- [ ] I tested my rules and they work

---

### Part 4: Rule Organization (5 minutes)

**Activity: "Priority Rules"**

**Discussion:**
- Some rules are more important than others
- Important rules should be listed first
- Less important rules can be listed later

**Organization Example:**
1. **Most Important (Safety/Appropriateness)**
   - Always use age-appropriate content
   - Never include violence

2. **Important (Quality)**
   - Always have clear structure
   - Always include engaging details

3. **Nice to Have (Style)**
   - Use descriptive language
   - Include dialogue when possible

**Students organize their rules by importance.**

---

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment

- **Rule categorization:** Can students identify rule types?
- **Rule writing:** Are rules specific and clear?
- **Rule testing:** Do students test and adjust rules?

### Summative Assessment

**Task:** Create a persona with:
1. At least 3 must-do rules
2. At least 2 must-not-do rules
3. At least 2 style rules
4. Rules organized by importance
5. Evidence that rules work (generated content)

**Rubric:** See `assessment-rubrics/lesson-03-rubric.md`

## Differentiation

### For Struggling Students

- Provide rule templates
- Give examples to modify
- Focus on one rule type at a time
- Use sentence starters

### For Advanced Students

- Write complex rules with conditions
- Create rule hierarchies
- Experiment with conflicting rules
- Document rule effectiveness

---

## Extension Activities

1. **Rule Experiment:** Test what happens when you remove a rule
2. **Rule Swap:** Try using someone else's rules
3. **Rule Evolution:** Improve rules based on test results

---

## Homework

**Optional:** Add 2 more rules to your persona and test them.

---

## Teacher Notes

### Common Challenges

- **"I don't know what rules to write"** → Use examples, brainstorm together
- **"My rules are too vague"** → Help students be more specific
- **"Rules aren't working"** → Rules need to be clear and testable

### Success Indicators

- Students can identify rule types
- Students write specific, clear rules
- Students test and adjust rules
- Students see improvement in outputs
