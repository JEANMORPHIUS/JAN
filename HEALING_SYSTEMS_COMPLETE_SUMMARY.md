## THE 7 UNIVERSAL HEALING LAWS

### 1. **TRUTH HEALS, LIES HARM**
- Acknowledgment is the first step of healing
- What is denied persists. What is acknowledged can heal.
- The mirror never lies.

### 2. **RESTORATION OVER PUNISHMENT**
- Punishment creates more harm. Restoration creates healing.
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom.
- Broken people need healing, not judgment.

### 3. **COMMUNITY OVER ISOLATION**
- Healing happens in relationship, not isolation.
- We heal together, not alone.
- Isolation is the disease. Connection is the cure.

### 4. **WHOLENESS OVER FRAGMENTATION**
- Mind, body, spirit, heart all connected.
- Heal one part, all parts benefit.
- Fragmented approach creates fragmented healing.

### 5. **PREVENTION OVER TREATMENT**
- Address root causes before symptoms appear.
- Upstream solutions more effective than downstream fixes.
- An ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure.

### 6. **NATURE AS HEALER**
- Nature knows how to heal. Follow nature's patterns.
- Align with Earth's rhythms and cycles.
- Disconnection from nature creates disease.

### 7. **LOVE AS MEDICINE**
- Love heals all wounds.
- Fear creates all disease.
- Choose love over fear in every healing system.
