# Poem vs Song Differentiation: Core Guidelines

## Purpose
Defines clear differentiation between standalone poems and song lyrics. Ensures appropriate structure, rhyme, and format for each form.

**CORE PRINCIPLE: Poems and songs serve different purposes. Poems stand alone. Songs serve music. Both are important. Both honor emotion-first creation (Duygu Adamı principle).**

## The Foundation

### Poems: Standalone Expression
- **Purpose**: Stand alone as written/spoken word
- **Structure**: Flexible, poetic form (stanzas, free verse, etc.)
- **Rhyme**: Optional, serves the poem's rhythm
- **Meter**: Flexible, natural speech rhythm
- **Music**: Not required (but can be adapted later)
- **Format**: Written/spoken word

### Songs: Musical Expression
- **Purpose**: Serve the music, complement the beat
- **Structure**: Musical sections (verse, chorus, bridge, etc.)
- **Rhyme**: Essential, must complement music
- **Meter**: Must match BPM and musical rhythm
- **Music**: Required, lyrics serve the music
- **Format**: Song structure with sections

### Rhythm and Meter

#### Poems

#### Songs

### Emotion-First (Duygu Adamı)

#### Both Poems and Songs

5. **Test readability**: Does it read well aloud?
6. **Format as poem**: Use poem structure, not song structure

### Creating a Song

7. **Mark rhyme schemes**: Use (A), (B), (C) notation
