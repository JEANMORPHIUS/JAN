## STRATEGIC IMPACT

### What We Break

**Political Systems Analyzed:**
1. Welfare dependency (2000+ years of creating dependence)
2. Judicial corruption ("Who judges when everything is wrong?")
3. Economic separation (war systems divide humanity)
4. Information control (propaganda vs truth)
5. Loss of legitimacy (truth exposure destroys corrupt systems)

**Our Approach:**
- Truth in language people understand
- Universal access (offline capability)
- Community ownership (local delivery)
- Transparency (open documentation)
- Independence (corruption safeguards)

### What We Build

**Human Needs Served:**
1. Dignity and respect ✅
2. Autonomy and self-determination ✅
3. Belonging and community ✅
4. Purpose and meaning ✅
5. Truth and knowledge ✅
6. Hope and opportunity ✅
7. Connection to sacred/spiritual ✅
8. Justice and fairness ✅
9. Security and safety ✅

**Delivery Mechanisms:**
- Education (655 lessons → Truth and knowledge)
- Offline access (Pi kits → Universal access)
- Community ownership (local delivery → Belonging)
- Spiritual alignment (Divine Frequency → Connection)
- Transparency (open docs → Justice)
- Love & Service (The Table → All needs met)
