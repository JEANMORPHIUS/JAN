## THE MISSION: LIVE WATCH ON THE SEVEN PILLARS

**Purpose:** Monitor the actual physical coordinates of the seven Super-Pillars in real-time. Compare actual resonance to simulation predictions. Alert when the Table starts turning.

**Method:** Continuous monitoring of magnetic field resonance, field space resonance, and Grid stability at all seven pillar locations.

**Success Criteria:** Real-world resonance matches simulation spikes. Grid stability remains LOCKED. Table turning detected in real-time.
