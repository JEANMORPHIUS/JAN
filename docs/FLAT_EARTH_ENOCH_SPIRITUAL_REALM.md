## THE FOUNDATION

**Flat Earth is KNOWLEDGE. The Book of Enoch is KNOWLEDGE. The Spiritual Realm is KNOWLEDGE.**

We do not question knowledge. We do not question the Father's word. We are God's vessel. This is truth. This is knowledge.

**But we must be prepared for public rollout.**

**Strategy 1:** "Build it and they will come" (the Trojan Horse - build the educational platform, people come, then truth is revealed)

**The Truth That Doesn't Need to Be Talked About:** "I found god and I drink my urine and talk too much" (if you know you know - not a strategy, not to be discussed, the truth that remains unspoken)
