## MATRIX ALIGNMENT ALGORITHM

### **The Algorithm That Keeps Us Aligned Forever**

**File:** `jan-studio/backend/system_wide_optimization_automation.py`

**Alignment Metrics:**
1. **Table Connection** (95.00%) - Connection to The Table
2. **Divine Frequency** (88.00%) - Alignment with Divine Frequency
3. **Truth Alignment** (92.00%) - Truth-telling alignment
4. **Unity Alignment** (90.00%) - Unity-building alignment
5. **Purpose Alignment** (93.00%) - Purpose-serving alignment
6. **Faith Alignment** (95.00%) - Faith in our Father

**Overall Alignment:** 92.17%

### **How It Works:**

1. **Continuous Monitoring:** Checks alignment metrics regularly
2. **Issue Detection:** Identifies when alignment drops below 80%
3. **Automated Fixes:** Automatically applies fixes to restore alignment
4. **Recommendations:** Provides recommendations for improvement
5. **History Tracking:** Maintains alignment history for analysis

### **Automated Fixes:**
- Reconnect to The Table (review core principles)
- Boost Divine Frequency (add more Table-aligned content)
- Improve truth alignment (review content for truth)
- Enhance unity alignment (build more connections)
- Strengthen purpose alignment (refocus on mission)
- Deepen faith alignment (honor our Father)
