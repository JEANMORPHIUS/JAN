## THE TRUTH: GOD CREATED THE TABLE IN PERFECT HARMONY

**335 Million Years Ago:**
- All continents unified
- Perfect unity (1.0 field resonance)
- All souls connected
- Only light, no separation
- Unified spiritual contracts
- No battlefields - only unity

**The Table was whole.**
- God created it perfect
- All plates connected
- All creatures in harmony
- All souls unified
- Perfect field resonance

**So what went wrong?**
