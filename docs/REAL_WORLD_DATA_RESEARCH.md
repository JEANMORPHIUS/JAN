---

## DATA COLLECTION PRIORITIES

### High Priority Events

**1. Major Earthquakes (M7.0+)**
- Document location, magnitude, date
- Connect to tectonic plates
- Track field resonance impact
- Link to nearby heritage sites

**2. Tsunamis**
- Document triggering events
- Track affected regions
- Measure impact on heritage sites
- Field resonance changes

**3. Volcanic Eruptions (VEI 4+)**
- Document location, date, VEI
- Track ash clouds and climate impact
- Connect to plate boundaries
- Heritage site connections

**4. Major Tectonic Shifts**
- Plate boundary activations
- Fault movements
- Subduction events
- Rift formations

---

## HERITAGE SITE CONNECTIONS

### Linking Events to Sites

**How It Works:**
1. Document event (earthquake, disaster, etc.)
2. Find nearby heritage sites (within 100km radius)
3. Calculate field resonance impact
4. Track temporal patterns
5. Map to tectonic plates

**Example Connections:**
- 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake → Angkor Wat (distant, but same plate)
- 2011 Tohoku Earthquake → Pacific Ring of Fire sites
- Machu Picchu → Nazca/South American plate boundary
- Great Pyramid → African/Eurasian plate boundary (distant)

## RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

### How to Document

**1. Document Event**
```python
from scripts.real_world_data_research import RealWorldDataResearch

research = RealWorldDataResearch()

event = research.document_event(
    event_name="2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami",
    event_type="natural_disaster",
    date=date(2004, 12, 26),
    location={"lat": 3.316, "lon": 95.854},
    region="Southeast Asia",
    country="Indonesia",
    tectonic_plates=["indo_australian", "eurasian"],
    magnitude=9.1,
    description="Massive undersea earthquake triggered devastating tsunami",
    sources=["USGS", "NOAA"]
)
```

**2. Research Tectonic Activity**
```python
pacific_research = research.research_tectonic_activity("pacific")
# Returns: All events on Pacific plate, heritage sites, movement data
```

**3. Export Data**
```python
export_path = research.export_research_data()
# Exports: All events, plates, connections, field resonance impacts
```
