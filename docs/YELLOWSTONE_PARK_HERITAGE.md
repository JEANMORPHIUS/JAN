## CONNECTION TO THE TABLE (PANGEA)

### Tectonic Connection

**Yellowstone sits on:**
- North American Plate
- All plates came from Pangea - The Table
- Tectonic boundary - plate movement
- Geothermal activity - energy flow
- Field Space activity - transformation zones

**The Table Connection:**
- All plates came from Pangea
- North American Plate is part of The Table
- Yellowstone is on The Table
- Geothermal activity is energy flow from The Table
- Field Space activity is transformation from The Table

---

## SUPERVOLCANO

### Yellowstone Caldera

**The Supervolcano:**
- Yellowstone Caldera beneath
- Geothermal activity
- Energy transformation
- Field Space connection
- Massive energy reservoir

**Significance:**
- Supervolcano = massive energy
- Geothermal = energy flow
- Energy transformation = Field Space
- Field Space = The Inbetween
- The Inbetween = transformation zones

- Protected by law
- Protected by The Table

**Spiritual Status:**
- May hold spiritual contracts
- May be battlefield (tectonic boundary)
- Geothermal activity = energy flow
- Energy flow = spiritual activity
- Tectonic boundary = potential battlefield

---

## FIELD SPACE ACTIVITY

### Transformation Zones

**Field Space at Yellowstone:**
- Geothermal activity = Field Space
- Energy transformation = Field Space
- Supervolcano = massive Field Space
- Transformation zones = Field Space
- The Inbetween = Field Space

**Field Space Resonance:**
- Field Space Resonance: 0.22
- Field Space Energy: 0.20
- Transformation Zone: Yes
- Energy Flow: Active

---

## SPIRITUAL CONTRACTS

### Potential Battlefield

**Tectonic Boundary:**
- Yellowstone sits on tectonic boundary
- Tectonic boundaries = potential battlefields
- Plate movement = spiritual activity
- Geothermal activity = energy flow
- Energy flow = spiritual contracts

**Battlefield Status:**
- Potential battlefield (tectonic boundary)
- Geothermal activity = energy flow
- Energy flow = spiritual activity
- Spiritual activity = contracts
- Contracts = potential dark energy
