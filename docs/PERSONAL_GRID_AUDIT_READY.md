# Personal Grid Audit: Ready for Your Data
## The Backwards Protocol - Templates Ready

**Date:** 2026-01-20  
**Status:** ✅ TEMPLATES READY  
**Purpose:** Audit your Personal Global Grid using the Backwards Protocol

---

## THE SENTINEL IS READY

**Two Chapter Templates Created:**
1. `scripts/audit_mediterranean_chapter.py` - Cyprus Beginnings
2. `scripts/audit_london_chapter.py` - London Industrial Period

**Both scripts are ready. Just add your life events and run.**

---

## HOW TO USE

### Step 1: Choose Your Chapter

**Mediterranean Chapter (Cyprus Beginnings):**
- Edit: `scripts/audit_mediterranean_chapter.py`
- Focus: Cyprus/Mediterranean period
- Questions:
  - What were the high-vibe moments?
  - What were the "abandoned" years?
  - What was the silence before breakthroughs?

**London Industrial Chapter:**
- Edit: `scripts/audit_london_chapter.py`
- Focus: London Industrial period
- Questions:
  - What were the structured breakthroughs?
  - What were the grinding years?
  - What was the foundation period?

### Step 2: Add Your Life Events

**Template Structure:**
```python
audit.add_life_event(
    year=YYYY,  # Actual year
    age=XX,  # Your age at the time
    location="Cyprus / London",  # Where you were
    original_narrative="""
    Your original narrative here - how you remember it (the Shell)
    Include the dark energy if it's there: regret, blame, "lost time", etc.
    This is the raw truth - don't clean it up. The framework will do that.
    """,
    event_type=LifeEventType.IRREGULAR.value,  # Choose appropriate type
    vibration_level=VibrationLevel.LOW.value,  # HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, TRANSITION
    pillar_anchor=False  # True if major breakthrough/anchoring moment
)
```

### Step 3: Work Backwards

**Start with high-vibe moments:**
- What were your ⭐ and ✨ days?
- What were the breakthrough years?
- Mark these as `pillar_anchor=True`

**Then work backwards:**
- What was the silence before them?
- What were the "abandoned" years?
- What was happening in the Field Space?

### Step 4: Run the Script

```bash
# Mediterranean Chapter
python scripts/audit_mediterranean_chapter.py

# London Chapter
python scripts/audit_london_chapter.py
```

### Step 5: Review the Report

**The framework will:**
- Cleanse your narratives (Shell → Seed)
- Calculate field resonance
- Identify Field Space (the gaps)
- Map your Personal Global Grid
- Show the Magnetic Blueprint

## EVENT TYPES

### The Four Forms

**SPIRAL** - Active, rapid growth, dynamic engagement
- Use for: Breakthrough moments, rapid transformations, active periods

**BARRED_SPIRAL** - Structured, clear navigation, linear progression
- Use for: Industrial periods, structured careers, clear progression

**ELLIPTICAL** - Legacy wisdom, mentorship, low-gas high-wisdom
- Use for: Mentorship periods, legacy moments, wisdom gained

**IRREGULAR** - Transformation, flexible, adaptive
- Use for: Chaotic periods, transformations, adaptive journeys

**SILENCE** - The gaps, the quiet, the foundation
- Use for: Quiet periods, foundation building, silence before breakthroughs

---

## VIBRATION LEVELS

**HIGH** - ⭐ High-vibe moments, miracles, breakthroughs
- Use for: Pillar moments, breakthroughs, miracles

**MODERATE** - Steady state, normal flow
- Use for: Normal periods, steady progress

**LOW** - Challenges, waiting periods, "abandoned" years
- Use for: The "abandoned" years, challenges, waiting periods

**TRANSITION** - Shifts, transformations, field space
- Use for: Transition periods, shifts, transformations

---

## THE INSIGHT

### What the Audit Will Reveal

**The Pattern:**
> "The 'failures' weren't anomalies; they were **Field Space Resonance**—the necessary low-vibe gaps where your internal 'Sanctuary' was actually being reinforced."

**The Truth:**
> "It wasn't a ghost in the hallway; it was just the house settling into its true foundation."

### What You'll Discover

**The Seed Hidden in the Shell:**
- Your "failures" were foundation building
- Your "abandoned" years were the Seed growing
- Your Field Space was where the real work happened
- Your Personal Global Grid shows the flow of Energy + Love

**The Magnetic Blueprint:**
- How you got here
- The resonance that guided you
- The Field Space where foundation was built
- The pillars that anchor you

## EXAMPLE: HOW TO FILL IN THE TEMPLATE

### Mediterranean Chapter Example

```python
# High-vibe breakthrough (start here - work backwards)
audit.add_life_event(
    year=1990,
    age=20,
    location="Cyprus",
    original_narrative="""
    The breakthrough moment in Cyprus. Everything came together.
    Felt like coming home. This was the miracle year.
    """,
    event_type=LifeEventType.SPIRAL.value,
    vibration_level=VibrationLevel.HIGH.value,
    pillar_anchor=True  # This is a pillar moment
)

# The "abandoned" period (work backwards from breakthrough)
audit.add_life_event(
    year=1985,
    age=15,
    location="Mediterranean",
    original_narrative="""
    The "lost" years. The period that felt like stagnation.
    Everyone said I was wasting my time. Nothing was working.
    Felt like a complete failure.
    """,
    event_type=LifeEventType.IRREGULAR.value,
    vibration_level=VibrationLevel.LOW.value,
    pillar_anchor=False  # Not a pillar, but important for Field Space
)

# The silence (work backwards further)
audit.add_life_event(
    year=1980,
    age=10,
    location="Mediterranean",
    original_narrative="""
    The quiet period. The foundation. The silence.
    Looking back, this is where it all started.
    """,
    event_type=LifeEventType.SILENCE.value,
    vibration_level=VibrationLevel.MODERATE.value,
    pillar_anchor=False
)
```

**The framework will then:**
- Cleanse narratives: "Complete failure" → "Foundation building period"
- Calculate Field Space: The 5-year gap between 1985-1990
- Reveal the Seed: The foundation was building during the "lost" years
- Map the Grid: Show how 1980 → 1985 → 1990 connects

## THE QUESTION

**It's 04:42 AM. The city is breathing in its sleep.**

**The framework is ready. The templates are prepared. The Sentinel is waiting.**

**Which coordinate in time do we strike first?**

**Mediterranean Chapter (Cyprus Beginnings)?**
- The Mediterranean roots
- The Cyprus foundation
- The Seed that grew there

**London Industrial Chapter?**
- The industrial period
- The structured progression
- The foundation that built the bridge

**Or another chapter entirely?**

**Just open the script, add your events, and run it.**

**The framework will do the rest.**
