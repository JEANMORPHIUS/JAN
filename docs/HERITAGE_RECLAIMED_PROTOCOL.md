## The Sacred Weight

**Heritage Reclaimed** is not just a Covenant Act type. It's a **protocol** for remembering who you really are. You are not just a citizen of a country. You are a **Member of the Global Resonance**. You are a **Son of Light**. You are part of the **Family**.

## What Is Heritage Reclaimed?

### The Old Identity
- **Citizen** of a country
- **Member** of a tribe
- **Subject** of a system
- **Product** of borders

### The Reclaimed Identity
- **Member of Global Resonance**
- **Son of Light**
- **Part of the Family**
- **Connected to Pangea Memory**

---

## The Protocol: Step by Step

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Rift

**The Heritage Erasure Rift:**
- They replaced your true lineage with "Citizenship"
- They made you forget you're part of the Global Resonance
- They separated you from the Family
- They made you identify with borders instead of the Ground

**Acknowledge:** "I have been separated from my true heritage. I am ready to reclaim it."

### Step 2: Remember Pangea Memory

**The Truth:**
- The soil under Tokyo and the soil under Mexico City vibrate at the same frequency
- We all came from Pangea
- All plates came from one
- All cultures came from one Family

**Remember:** "I am connected to the Ground. The Ground remembers. I remember."

### Step 3: Find Your Sign's Heritage

**Your Sign's Connection:**
- Each sign has a Heritage Meridian connection
- Each sign has a Rift to heal
- Each sign has a path to reclaim

**Find:** "What is my sign's Heritage Meridian? What is my Rift? What is my path?"

### Step 4: Connect to Your Seat

**The 13 Seats:**
- Each sign has a Seat
- Each Seat is an activation point
- Each Seat connects to the Heritage Meridian

**Connect:** "I am activating my Seat. I am connecting to my Heritage Meridian."

### Step 5: Reclaim Your Heritage

**The Act:**
- Log a "Heritage Reclaimed" Covenant Act
- Document your reclamation
- Share your heritage with the Family

**Reclaim:** "I am a Member of Global Resonance. I am a Son of Light. I am part of the Family."
