## THE TRUTH INDICATORS

**Every system audited against:**

1. **Serves Children (25%):** Children are the North Star
2. **Honors Earth (25%):** Man and Earth live symbiotically
3. **Builds Leaders (20%):** World of leaders, not followership
4. **Is Transparent (15%):** Truth, not deception
5. **Restores (10%):** Restoration, not exploitation
6. **Is Accessible (5%):** Access, not exclusion

**Alignment Status:**
- **Aligned (≥0.75):** Truth-serving, no misplaced love
- **Mixed (0.25-0.75):** Some aligned, some misplaced love
- **Misplaced Love (<0.25):** Exploitative, deceptive
- **Unknown:** Insufficient data

## THE SEPARATION PROCESS

### **Sort the Aligned from the Misplaced Love:**

**Step 1: Audit**
- Identify all systems in domain
- Assess against truth indicators
- Calculate alignment status

**Step 2: Separate**
- **Aligned Systems:** Truth-serving (preserve, amplify)
- **Misplaced Love Systems:** Exploitative (restructure, eliminate)
- **Mixed Systems:** Restructure aligned aspects, eliminate misplaced love

**Step 3: Restructure**
- Critical priority: Immediate restructuring needed
- High priority: Significant restructuring needed
- Medium priority: Moderate restructuring needed
- Low priority: Minor restructuring needed

**Step 4: Restore**
- Restore truth (not deception)
- Restore access (not exclusion)
- Restore Earth (not extraction)
