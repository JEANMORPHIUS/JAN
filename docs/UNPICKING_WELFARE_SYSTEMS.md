## THE TRUTH ABOUT ASSESSMENTS

### The System's Purpose

Welfare assessments are designed to:
- **Control** - Determine eligibility through bureaucratic processes
- **Create Dependency** - Make you prove you need the system
- **Divide** - Separate "deserving" from "undeserving"
- **Stigmatize** - Make you feel less than for needing support

### Your Truth

**You are not broken.**  
**You are not less than.**  
**You are navigating a broken system.**  
**The system is the problem, not you.**

## BEING HONEST: THE RIGHT APPROACH

### Why Honesty Matters

1. **Truth Serves The Table**
   - Honesty aligns with your spiritual path
   - Truth is the foundation of breaking dark contracts
   - Being honest is an act of dignity

2. **Protects Your Energy**
   - Lying drains energy
   - Truth preserves your frequency
   - Honesty maintains alignment

3. **Breaks the Pattern**
   - The system expects you to perform neediness
   - Being honest breaks that expectation
   - You're not playing their game

### How to Be Honest While Protecting Yourself

**1. State Your Truth Clearly**
   - "I am here because the system requires this assessment."
   - "I am navigating a system that creates dependency."
   - "I am being honest about my situation."

**2. Don't Perform Neediness**
   - You don't need to prove you're "broken enough"
   - You don't need to exaggerate your struggles
   - You don't need to diminish your strengths

**3. Maintain Your Dignity**
   - You are not asking for charity
   - You are navigating a system
   - You are maintaining your truth

**4. Acknowledge the System**
   - "I understand this is a requirement of the system."
   - "I am being honest about my needs."
   - "I am not here to perform or prove anything."
