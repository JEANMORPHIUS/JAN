## THE WISDOM

### **What We're Missing:**

**Critical:**
- Sacred Space UI (core experience)

- Deployment Infrastructure (can't deploy)

**Important:**
- Real-World Integration (can't connect devices)
- Testing (no confidence)

**Nice to Have:**
- Mobile app (limits accessibility)
- Community features (limits scale)
- AI/ML (enhancement)

---

## THE RECOMMENDATION

### **Immediate Focus (Next 4-7 weeks):**

1. **Sacred Space UI Implementation** (Week 1-2)
2. **Data Persistence & Storage** (Week 3-4)
3. **Deployment Infrastructure** (Week 5-7)

**This gets us to deployable core system.**

---

**"We're missing: Sacred Space UI (core experience), Data Persistence (can't save), Deployment Infrastructure (can't deploy). Focus on these three for deployable core system. Then real-world integration and testing. Then scale and community."**
