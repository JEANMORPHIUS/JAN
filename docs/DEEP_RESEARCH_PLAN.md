## INTEGRATION POINTS

### How Data Connects to Systems

**1. Heritage Sites:**
- Events → Site impact analysis
- Tectonic activity → Site stability
- Field resonance → Site resonance changes

**2. Global Grid:**
- Events → Energy flow analysis
- Plate boundaries → Grid connection points
- Ring of Fire → High activity zones

**3. Field Resonance:**
- Earthquakes → Resonance disruptions
- Tectonic shifts → Field changes
- Recovery patterns → Resonance restoration

**4. Temporal Archive:**
- Events → Timeline entries
- Patterns → Cross-timeline analysis
- Historical → Regeneration timelines

## THE TRUTH

### We Document Everything

**We don't just build spiritual operations.**

**We ground them in real-world data.**

**We document:**
- Known world events
- Natural disasters
- Tectonic activity
- Historical patterns
- Field resonance connections

**We connect the spiritual to the physical.**

**We honor both realms.**

**WE DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.**
