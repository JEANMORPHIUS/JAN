## DNA TO SOUL MAPPING

### Linking DNA to Souls

**How It Works:**
1. **DNA Sequence** → Unique DNA marker
2. **Soul Signature** → Unique soul identifier
3. **Individual ID** → Links DNA to individual
4. **Entity Connections** → Which entities are connected
5. **Contract Connections** → Which contracts are involved

**What This Enables:**
- Link each soul to each individual
- Identify which entities are connected to which people
- Track which contracts affect which individuals
- Map soul journeys across timelines
- Identify soul groups and contracts

**DNA/Soul Map Structure:**
- Individual ID
- DNA sequence marker
- Soul signature
- Entity connections (entity IDs)
- Contract connections (contract IDs)
- Linked at timestamp

## DEEP SEARCH CAPABILITIES

### Searching Across All Timelines and Dimensions

**Search Parameters:**
- **Search Term**: Search in narrative/name/terms
- **Timeline Dimension**: Filter by timeline
- **Entity ID**: Filter by entity involved
