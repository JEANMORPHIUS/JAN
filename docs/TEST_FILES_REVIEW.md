## FILE 1: `scripts/test_seed_to_movement.py`

### What It Is
A test script for the Seed to Movement System - tests the revolution framework and People's Court strategy.

### Does It Work?
**YES** - The module exists and is actively used:
- ✅ Module exists: `jan-studio/backend/seed_to_movement.py`
- ✅ API exists: `jan-studio/backend/seed_to_movement_api.py`
- ✅ Integrated in main.py: Router is included
- ✅ Test script is functional

### What It Tests
- Seed to Movement path (phases, status)
- People's Court strategy
- Revolution plan creation
- Revolution framework

### Is It Useful?
**YES - KEEP IT**

**Reason:**
- Tests an active system (Seed to Movement API)
- Verifies functionality of revolution framework
- Important for system validation
- Actually works (not broken)

### Recommendation
**KEEP** - This is a valid, working test for an active system.

## FILE 2: Duplicate Entry

### What It Is
The same file appears twice in the analysis report - this is a duplicate entry, not a second file.

### Recommendation
**IGNORE** - It's the same file listed twice in the report.

## SUMMARY

| File | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `test_seed_to_movement.py` | **ACTIVE & USEFUL** | **KEEP** |
| Duplicate entry | Not a real file | Ignore |

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**KEEP ALL TEST FILES**

**Reason:**
- The "2 inactive" files were actually:
  - 1 valid test file (test_seed_to_movement.py) - KEEP
  - 1 duplicate entry in report - not a real file

**All 60 test files are useful and should be kept.**
