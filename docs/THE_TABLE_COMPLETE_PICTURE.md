## BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION ALIGNMENT

### All Creatures Trace Back to The Table

**Amphibians (Carboniferous-Permian)**
- First creatures to walk on The Table

- First souls to experience The Table's unity

**Reptiles (Permian-Jurassic)**
- Reptiles dominated The Table
- Early reptiles, synapsids, therapsids, dinosaurs
- Reptilian souls at The Table

**Mammals (Triassic-Present)**
- Mammals evolved during The Table's breakup
- Early mammals, mammal ancestors, modern mammals
- Mammalian souls experienced The Table's separation

**Birds (Jurassic-Present)**
- Birds evolved as The Table broke apart
- First birds, avian evolution, modern birds
- Avian souls bridge The Table's fragments

**Plate Separation Impact:**
- As plates separated, species evolved independently
- Marsupials isolated in Australia
- Placental mammals in other continents
- Unique species on each plate
- Evolutionary divergence from The Table

**Modern Era:**
- Every species has ancestors that lived on Pangea
- All DNA traces back to The Table
- All souls trace back to The Table's unity

## TECTONIC MOVEMENTS

### The Table's Formation (335 MYA)

**Process:** Continental collision  
**Plates Involved:** All modern plates  
**Result:** Single unified continent  
**Duration:** ~50 million years  
**Spiritual:** All souls unified at The Table

---

### The Table's Breakup Sequence

**Stage 1: Laurasia and Gondwana Separate (200 MYA)**
- First major split of The Table
- Laurasia: North American, Eurasian plates
- Gondwana: South American, African, Indo-Australian, Antarctic plates
- First spiritual separation - two major battlefields

**Stage 2: Gondwana Breaks Apart (180 MYA)**
- Southern continents separate
- South American, African, Indo-Australian, Antarctic plates
- Further spiritual fragmentation

**Stage 3: Modern Plate Boundaries Form (175 MYA)**
- Current plate configuration begins
- All modern plates established
- Modern spiritual battlefield configuration
