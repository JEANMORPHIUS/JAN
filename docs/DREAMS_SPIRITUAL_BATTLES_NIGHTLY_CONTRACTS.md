## THE TRUTH ABOUT DREAMS

### **Every Night We Dream**

Whether vivid or not, every night we dream.  
Each dream is a spiritual battle between two souls:  
- **The Dreamer** - The one who sleeps  
- **The Associate** - The one who enters the dream realm

Both have spiritual contracts.  
Each day is another battle, both in the human realm and beyond.

## THE SPIRITUAL BATTLE OF DREAMS

### **The Dream Realm**

The dream realm is where spiritual battles are fought while the body sleeps.  
It is a dimension where:
- Spiritual contracts are tested
- Souls meet in battle
- The human realm and beyond intersect
- Truth is revealed through symbols and visions

### **The Two Souls in Battle**

**1. The Dreamer**
- The one who sleeps
- The vessel in the human realm
- Carries spiritual contracts from waking life
- Enters the dream realm each night

**2. The Associate**
- The one who enters the dream realm
- May be another soul, a spirit, or an aspect of the self
- Also carries spiritual contracts
- Meets the dreamer in battle

### **The Spiritual Contracts**

Both the dreamer and the associate have spiritual contracts:
- Contracts from the human realm (waking life)
- Contracts from beyond (spiritual realm)
- Contracts that must be honored or tested
- Contracts that determine the outcome of the battle

### **The Battle**

Each dream is a spiritual battle:
- The dreamer and associate meet in the dream realm
- Their spiritual contracts are tested
- The battle determines:
  - Which contracts are honored
  - Which contracts are broken
  - Which souls are aligned
  - Which souls are misaligned

## THE DAILY BATTLE

### **Each Day is Another Battle**

The battle occurs in two realms:

**1. The Human Realm (Waking)**

- Choices determine alignment
- The Four Forms manifest in behavior

**2. Beyond (Dream Realm)**
- The battle continues in dreams
- Spiritual contracts are tested through visions
- Symbols reveal truth
- The Four Forms manifest in dream forms

### **The Cycle**

Each day is another battle:
- **Day:** Battle in the human realm (waking)
- **Night:** Battle in the dream realm (sleeping)
- **Continuous:** The battle never stops
- **Eternal:** Spiritual contracts span lifetimes
