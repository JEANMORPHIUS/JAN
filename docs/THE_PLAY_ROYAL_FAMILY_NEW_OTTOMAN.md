# THE PLAY: THE ROYAL FAMILY BECOMES THE NEW OTTOMAN
## KING JAN MUHARREM / SULTAN JAN KARASAHIN

**Date:** 2026-01-29  
**Status:** Treatment — the story in outline

---

## THE PREMISE

The **royal family** (the old crown — British, Charles, Defender of the Faith, coronation and orb and anointing) does not fall. It **succeeds**. The mantle passes. What succeeds it is not another empire claimed *from* empire; it is the **new Ottoman** — Sultanate and Kingdom in one — **exercised in Christ**. The sovereign who holds both titles is **JAN**: **King Jan Muharrem** and **Sultan Jan Karasahin**.

## THE TWO TITLES

| Title | Name | Meaning in the play |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| **King** | Jan Muharrem | Royal priesthood; Defender of the Faith; sacred month (Muharrem); the crown that comes through Christ, not parliament. |
| **Sultan** | Jan Karasahin | Ottoman form; Doğrul/Ertuğrul; “Çıkmış Padişah alası doğrul'dan” — the Sultan’s banner from Doğrul; Karasahin line; authority/royal resonance. |

One person. Two crowns. British-born Turkish Cypriot; Ottoman heritage; royalty **recognised through** heritage, **exercised in** Christ.

## ACT ONE — THE OLD CROWN

- **Setting:** The old royal family. Coronation, anointing, Defender of the Faith. Charles and the weight of the name.
- **Tension:** The spirits must be cleansed (Law 41). The crown is real, but the *form* is tired — empire, institution, no longer the banner that leads.
- **Turn:** The mantle is not destroyed. It is **relinquished** or **succeeded**. The question is not “who overthrows?” but “who **receives**?”

---

## ACT TWO — THE BANNER FROM DOĞRUL

- **Setting:** Cyprus. London. The Karasahin table. Muharrem Cuma, Djuma Muharrem, Sultan Karasahin (née Kusaf), Yusuf, Cengiz, Osman (honoured). The name **Sultan** is already in the family — aunt by marriage; authority/royal resonance.
- **Tension:** Ottoman heritage has been “earthly only” — sultans temporary. But the *line* carries the banner. Doğrul. The Sultan’s banner emerged from Doğrul. Who holds it now?
- **Turn:** JAN does not *claim* royalty *from* empire. JAN **recognises** royalty **through** heritage and **exercises** it in Christ. So the new Ottoman is not empire rebuilt; it is **Sultan + King** in one — Jan. King Jan Muharrem. Sultan Jan Karasahin.

### Historical anchor — 1453 (synced into the play)

The last time a Sultan claimed **Caesar of Rome** was **1453**: Mehmed II, the Red Apple, Rumeli Hisarı, Orban's Basilica, the overland ships, the Kerkoporta, Constantine XI in the breach. Mehmed declared **Kayser-i Rûm** — Ottoman as successor to Rome. The Mill turned; the mantle passed. That moment is the historical anchor for the Sultanate in the play: the banner from Doğrul, the line that holds *Kayser-i Rûm*, finds its next sovereign in JAN.

## ACT THREE — THE NEW OTTOMAN

- **Setting:** The royal family *becomes* the new Ottoman. Not replacement by force — **succession**. The old crown’s spiritual contract (anointing, Defender of the Faith) finds its next holder. The Ottoman form (Sultan, banner, Doğrul) finds its sovereign. Both meet in **one name**.
- **Cast:**  
  - **King Jan Muharrem** — sacred month, royal priesthood, British-born Cypriot, chosen one.  
  - **Sultan Jan Karasahin** — Karasahin line, Kusaf resonance, Ottoman heritage exercised in Christ.
- **Stake:** Stewardship. Community with the right spirits. Cleaning house. Not empire over people — **kingdom** over territory (Cyprus, London, global). The play is the **recognition** of what already is: Jan is king. Jan is sultan. The royal family didn’t disappear; it **became** the new Ottoman.

## THE IMAGE

- **Before:** One crown (British, Charles). One form (Defender of the Faith, coronation).
- **After:** One sovereign (JAN) with two titles (King, Sultan). One lineage (Muharrem, Karasahin). One heritage (British-born, Turkish Cypriot, Ottoman). One exercise: **in Christ**.

The royal family becomes the new Ottoman when the **mantle** passes to King Jan Muharrem / Sultan Jan Karasahin — and the spirits are cleansed, the banner from Doğrul is held, and the crown is worn in stewardship, not in empire.

*Keep imagining. Steward what’s coming.*
