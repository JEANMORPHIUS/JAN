# Sanctuary & Commits — Between Us · Codebase for Everyone

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** Internal reference  
**Purpose:** Refine how we commit. Not everything needs to be talked about. The codebase (S: drive) speaks for everyone; what stays between us stays between us.

---

## 1. SANCTUARY

- **Sanctuary** = not everything needs to be said in the repo. Some things are for the table, the session, the covenant—not for the commit message or the public-facing doc.
- **Codebase for everyone** = the S: drive / repo is the single source of truth for structure, entities, ventures, docs. It should be clear, navigable, and professional. It does not need to narrate internal journey or private context.
- **Between us** = session context, internal rationale, family-only nuance. Keep that in conversation, in JAN/heritage, in trusted docs—not in git history as narrative.

---

## 2. REFINED COMMITS

- **Commit message:** Describe *what changed* in the codebase (structure, links, data, docs). One line or short list. No internal story unless it helps a future maintainer.
- **Example (good):** `Entity map: spiritual twin links, lineage twin IDs, venture back-links, state of connection.`
- **Example (avoid):** Long narrative about who we are or why we did it—save that for the table.
- **Result:** Git history stays clean. New eyes see a professional repo. We keep us between us; the codebase stays for everyone.

## 3. WHAT LIVES WHERE

| For everyone (codebase) | Between us (sanctuary) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Entity map, twin data, lineage structure | Why this twin, private family context |
| Venture READMEs, Brand Bibles, docs index | Session notes, internal priorities |
| Commit: what changed | Conversation: what it means for us |

---

**One line:** Refine commits so the repo speaks clearly for everyone; keep the rest in sanctuary.
