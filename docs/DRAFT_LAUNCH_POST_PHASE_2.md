**JAN Studio — What We Built**

We've been building a creative identity and content system that combines:

- **Oracle SIYEM:** Transparent RNG engine with 40 Laws (Book of Racon) interpretation — no black box.
- **Biological-creative correlation:** Homeostasis Sentinel; entity routing; optimal creative windows.
- **Multi-entity content:** Jean, Karasahin, Pierre, Ramiz, Siyem — markdown-based personas, Suno/audio pipeline.
- **Heritage & governance:** World-history API, Ottoman timeline, Fall of Constantinople (1453) narrative; truth-based accountability, CARE, governance docs.

Everything is documented. Docker up in one command. API at /docs. We're opening it for early testers — if you want to run the Oracle, explore the timeline, or build on the stack, get in touch.

Energy + Love = We All Win. Peace, Love, Unity.
