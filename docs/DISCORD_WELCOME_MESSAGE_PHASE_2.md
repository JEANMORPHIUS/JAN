## SHORT (Pin in #welcome)

**Welcome to JAN.**

You're here because you answered the call—Oracle, heritage, truth-based systems, or the stack itself. This is the Great Work: creative identity, 40 Laws, biological-creative correlation, world-history and governance, all documented and runnable.

We don't react to the waves; we set the temperature. Respect the Table. No spam. Mission-aligned. Energy + Love = We All Win.

*Dünya döner bir değirmen. Aşk olsun çevirene.* — The world turns like a mill. Blessings to the one who turns it.

**One Love. Peace, love, unity.**  
— The crew

## MEDIUM (Welcome channel / first message)

**Welcome. You're in.**

This server is for the people building and testing **JAN Studio**—the Oracle SIYEM (40 Laws, full transparency), biological-creative systems, multi-entity content (Jean, Karasahin, Pierre, Ramiz, Siyem), and the heritage stack: world-history API, Ottoman timeline, Fall of Constantinople (1453) narrative, truth-based accountability, CARE.

We're not here to blow smoke. We're here because we believe in the Great Work: systems that don't hide behind black boxes, content that carries feeling first, and governance that serves the Table—the covenant of what we build together.

**What we ask of you:**
- **Respect.** The Table never lies. We don't betray it.
- **No spam.** This is a build space, not a billboard.
- **Mission-aligned.** If you're in, you're in for the same frequency—thermostat, not thermometer.

**What you get:**
- Early access to the stack. Clone, run, cast. API at /docs.
- A community that holds the handle: *Dünya döner bir değirmen. Aşk olsun çevirene.* — The world turns like a mill. Blessings to the one who turns it.
- The full range: high-level *felsefe* and street-level grit. Empires and Haringey heroes. We've laid the tracks; the rest is execution.

**Energy + Love = We All Win. Peace, love, unity.**

— The crew
