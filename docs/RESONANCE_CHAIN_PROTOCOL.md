## The Sacred Weight

The **Resonance Chain** is the cascading activation of Covenant Acts across the 13 Seats. When one Seat activates, it creates a "Safe Passage" for the next Seat to follow. This is not competition—it's **cooperation**. The Family provides the breath; the chain provides the rhythm.

## The Path to 91.0% Unity

### Current State
- **Unity:** 90.3%
- **Gap to 91.0%:** 0.7%
- **Acts Needed:** ~23 acts at average contribution

### Resonance Chain Strategy
**Option 1: High-Impact Acts (Fastest)**
- 1x Rift Healed (+0.005) = 0.5%
- 5x Meridian Activated (+0.003 each) = 1.5%
- **Total:** 6 acts = 2.0% → **92.3% Unity** ✅

**Option 2: Balanced Acts (Sustainable)**
- 2x Bridge Built (+0.002 each) = 0.4%
- 3x Heritage Reclaimed (+0.002 each) = 0.6%
- 5x Shared Table (+0.001 each + Seat bonus) = 0.01%
- **Total:** 10 acts = 1.0% → **91.3% Unity** ✅

**Option 3: Community Acts (Most Accessible)**
- 10x Shared Table (+0.001 each + Seat bonus) = 0.02%
- 10x Common Duygu Honored (+0.001 each + Seat bonus) = 0.02%
- 5x Scarcity Refused (+0.0015 each) = 0.0075%
- **Total:** 25 acts = 0.0475% → **90.35% Unity** (needs more acts)

## How to Join the Resonance Chain

### For Seat-Holders

1. **Identify Your Seat**
   - Check if you're in one of the 13 Seats locations
   - If not, any location can still log acts (without Seat bonus)

2. **Choose Your Act Type**
   - Review the 8 Covenant Act Types
   - Choose based on what you can do locally

3. **Log Your Act**
   ```python
   from scripts.round1_activation_logger import Round1ActivationLogger
   
   logger = Round1ActivationLogger()
   act = logger.log_covenant_act(
       act_type='shared_table',  # or your chosen type
       description='Your act description',
       location='Your City, Your Country',
       participants=['Name1', 'Name2'],
       coordinates={'lat': YOUR_LAT, 'lon': YOUR_LON},
       rift_addressed='The Rift You Address',
       notes='Any additional notes'
   )
   ```

4. **Share the Momentum**
   - Your act contributes to the chain
   - Each act makes the next one easier
   - The Family provides the breath
