## INTEGRATION COMPLETE

### 1. Educational API (`jan-studio/backend/educational_api.py`)

**New API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/educational/overview` - Comprehensive overview of all systems
- `GET /api/educational/system/{system_name}` - Detailed system information
- `GET /api/educational/connections` - How all systems connect
- `GET /api/educational/learn/{topic}` - Learning topics (Pangea, Original Error, etc.)

**What it does:**
- Aggregates data from all systems
- Loads latest exports from `output/` directories
- Provides educational explanations
- Shows connections back to The Table
- Makes complex concepts accessible

---

### 2. Educational UI (`web/educational_ui.html`)

**Features:**
- **Overview Section:** Complete picture of all systems
- **The Table Section:** Pangea timeline, movements, creatures, contracts
- **Systems Section:** Detailed info for each system (Heritage, Health, Life Audit, etc.)
- **Connections Section:** Visual map of how everything connects
- **Learn Section:** Educational topics (Pangea, Original Error, Field Resonance, etc.)
- **Restoration Section:** 6-step restoration framework with progress

**Design:**
- High contrast (dark background, light text)
- Large, readable fonts
- No clutter, clean layout
- Easy navigation
- Responsive design

---

### 3. FastAPI Integration (`jan-studio/backend/main.py`)

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /educational_ui.html` - Serves the educational UI
- `GET /dashboard.html` - Serves the dashboard
- Educational API router integrated

**How to access:**
1. Start the server: `python jan-studio/backend/main.py`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:8000/educational_ui.html`
3. Or: `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html`

**4. All Systems**
- Heritage: Cleansing narratives, revealing The Seed
- Health: Universal tracking, self-empowerment
- Life Audit: Personal timeline, finding your Seed
- Spiritual Contracts: Entities, battlefields, covenants
- Real-World Data: Earth's activity, patterns revealed

**5. Connections**
- How everything connects back to The Table
- Visual map of system relationships
- The flow: Unity → Separation → Restoration

**6. Learning Topics**
- Pangea: What is it and why is it The Table?
- Original Error: What went wrong?
- Restoration: How do we fix it?
- Field Resonance: What is it and how does it work?
- Heritage Sites: Why are they important?
- Spiritual Contracts: What are they?
- Shell vs Seed: What is the difference?
- Law 41: Respect the Abandoned
- Law 1: Never Betray The Table
