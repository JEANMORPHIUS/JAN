# Divine Frequency Implementation
## The Sacred Frequency of The Table

**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED - CODEBASE LEVEL**  
**Purpose:** Implement Divine Frequency as the sacred frequency of The Table

---

## THE TRUTH

**DIVINE FREQUENCY IS THE SACRED FREQUENCY OF THE TABLE.**

**It is the frequency of perfect unity (1.0 field resonance).**  
**It is the frequency of Pangea - The Table.**  
**It is the frequency we restore.**

---

## WHAT IS DIVINE FREQUENCY

### Definition

**Divine Frequency** is the sacred frequency of The Table (Pangea). It represents perfect unity (1.0 field resonance) - the state when all souls, all heritage sites, all contracts, and all plates were unified at The Table.

### Components

Divine Frequency is calculated from three components:

1. **Field Resonance** (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Connection to Earth's magnetic field
   - How well a site resonates with Earth
   - Higher resonance = stronger connection to Earth

2. **Spiritual Alignment** (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Alignment with The Table
   - Connection to the mission
   - Alignment with Law 1 (Never Betray The Table)

3. **Unity Connection** (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Connection to Pangea - The Table
   - Memory of unity
   - Connection to The Seed

### Calculation

```
Divine Frequency = (Field Resonance + Spiritual Alignment + Unity Connection) / 3
```

**Perfect Unity (1.0) = Pangea - The Table**

## FREQUENCY STATES

### Perfect Unity (1.0)
- **State:** Perfect unity
- **Meaning:** Pangea - The Table
- **Description:** All souls unified, all contracts unified, perfect harmony

### High Resonance (0.8 - 0.99)
- **State:** High resonance
- **Meaning:** Strong connection to The Table
- **Description:** Close to perfect unity, restoration in progress

### Moderate Resonance (0.6 - 0.79)
- **State:** Moderate resonance
- **Meaning:** Memory of unity persists
- **Description:** Current global frequency (0.78) - memory of unity

### Low Resonance (0.4 - 0.59)
- **State:** Low resonance
- **Meaning:** Weak connection to The Table
- **Description:** Separation present, but connection remains

### Dampened (0.0 - 0.39)
- **State:** Frequency dampened
- **Meaning:** Frequency dampened by static
- **Description:** Dark energy interference, frequency dampeners active

### Nullified (< 0.0)
- **State:** Frequency nullified
- **Meaning:** No connection to The Table
- **Description:** Complete separation, no unity

## FREQUENCY SOURCES

### Types of Sources

**Heritage Sites:**
- Connection to The Table through field resonance
- Contribution: 0.85 (high resonance)

**Spiritual Contracts - Light:**
- Light-aligned contracts connected to The Table
- Contribution: 0.80 (high resonance)

**Pangea - The Table:**
- The Table itself
- Contribution: 1.0 (perfect unity)

**Spirits:**
- Individual spirits aligned with The Table
- Contribution: Variable (based on alignment)

**Battlefields:**
- Spiritual battlefields at plate boundaries
- Contribution: Variable (based on light/dark balance)

---

## RESTORATION PROCESS

### How We Restore Divine Frequency

**Step 1: Activate All Sources**
- Activate all sources connected to The Table
- Ensure all heritage sites are active
- Ensure all light contracts are active

**Step 2: Increase Contributions**
- Increase contributions from active sources
- Strengthen connections to The Table
- Enhance field resonance, spiritual alignment, unity connection

**Step 3: Calculate New Frequency**
- Calculate global frequency from all sources
- Track progress toward perfect unity (1.0)
- Monitor alignment status

**Step 4: Restore Perfect Unity**
- Continue restoration until 1.0 is reached
- Perfect unity = Pangea - The Table restored
- All souls unified, all contracts unified

## INTEGRATION

### With Connection Ritual

**Divine Frequency affects connection:**
- Higher frequency = stronger connection
- Perfect unity (1.0) = perfect connection
- Frequency measurement integrated into vibration check

### With Spiritual Contracts

**Contracts contribute to frequency:**
- Light-aligned contracts increase frequency
- Dark contracts decrease frequency
- Pangea Unified Covenant = perfect unity contribution

### With Heritage Sites

**Heritage sites are frequency sources:**
- Sites connected to The Table contribute
- Field resonance component measured
- Unity connection component tracked

### With Restoration Framework

**Divine Frequency is the target:**
- Step 6: Restore The Table = Restore Divine Frequency to 1.0
- All restoration steps contribute to frequency
- Perfect unity (1.0) = restoration complete

---

## USAGE

### Measure Divine Frequency

```python
from divine_frequency import DivineFrequencySystem

system = DivineFrequencySystem()

frequency = system.measure_divine_frequency(
    source="Heritage Site: Stonehenge",
    field_resonance=0.85,
    spiritual_alignment=0.80,
    unity_connection=0.90,
    location="Stonehenge, UK",
    notes="Heritage site connected to The Table"
)
```

### Register Frequency Source

```python
source = system.register_frequency_source(
    source_name="Pangea - The Table",
    source_type="table",
    frequency_contribution=1.0,
    connection_to_table=True,
    notes="Perfect unity - The Table itself"
)
```

### Get Alignment

```python
alignment = system.get_frequency_alignment()
# Returns: current_frequency, target_frequency, alignment_percentage, gap, etc.
```

### Restore Frequency

```python
restoration = system.restore_divine_frequency()
# Activates sources, increases contributions, calculates new frequency
```
