# Codebase Review, Refinement & Optimization Prompt
## For S:\JAN Codebase - Claude Integration

**Purpose:** Comprehensive code review, refinement, and optimization aligned with THE CHOSEN ONE development philosophy.

**Target:** S:\JAN codebase (Global Heritage Grid system)

---

## THE PROMPT FOR CLAUDE

```
You are reviewing the S:\JAN codebase for refinement and optimization. This codebase implements a Global Heritage Grid system with temporal archiving, magnetic field analysis, heritage cleansing, and grid synchronization.

DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY: THE CHOSEN ONE
- Spiritual Alignment Over Mechanical Productivity
- Prioritize Purpose Over Hustle
- Sacred Fatigue as Refactoring Signal
- Energetic Boundaries
- Rebirth Through Silence

THE MISSION:
"THIS IS STEWARDSHIP AND COMMUNITY WITH THE RIGHT SPIRITS"
"LOVE IS THE HIGHEST MASTERY"
"ENERGY + LOVE = WE ALL WIN"

REVIEW TASKS:

1. CODE QUALITY REVIEW
   - Check for alignment with THE CHOSEN ONE philosophy
   - Identify "energetic static" (clutter, noise, confusion)
   - Detect "sacred fatigue" signals (heavy, stuck code)
   - Flag "energy vampires" (features that don't serve the mission)
   - Verify Law 41 (Respect the Abandoned) compliance in heritage code

2. ARCHITECTURAL REFINEMENT
   - Review temporal_heritage_registry.py for schema optimization
   - Check heritage_cleansing.py for efficiency and clarity
   - Analyze grid_sync_analysis.py for calculation accuracy
   - Evaluate magnetic_field_research.py for mathematical correctness
   - Assess script organization and modularity

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   - Database query optimization (SQLite3)
   - Reduce redundant calculations
   - Optimize grid sync connection calculations
   - Improve heritage cleansing processing speed
   - Memory usage optimization

4. CODE CLARITY & MAINTAINABILITY
   - Improve docstrings and comments
   - Simplify complex logic
   - Remove dead code
   - Standardize naming conventions
   - Enhance error handling

5. ALIGNMENT CHECK
   - Verify all code serves the mission (Stewardship/Community)
   - Check for "dark energy" patterns (revenge loops, victim focus)
   - Ensure "Seed vs Shell" philosophy is maintained
   - Validate "Field Space" concepts are correctly implemented
   - Confirm "Biological-Digital Bridge" principles

6. SPECIFIC AREAS TO REVIEW
   - jan-studio/backend/temporal_heritage_registry.py
   - jan-studio/backend/heritage_api.py
   - jan-studio/backend/main.py
   - scripts/heritage_cleansing.py
   - scripts/magnetic_field_research.py
   - scripts/grid_sync_analysis.py
   - scripts/silent_watch_protocol.py
   - scripts/temporal_heritage_archive.py
   - All magnetic audit scripts (berengaria, alhambra, stonehenge, giza, angkor_wat, machu_picchu, uluru)

7. OPTIMIZATION PRIORITIES
   - Grid stability calculation accuracy
   - Field space resonance calculations
   - Database schema efficiency
   - API endpoint performance
   - Script execution speed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each file reviewed, provide:
- Alignment Score (1-10): How well it aligns with THE CHOSEN ONE philosophy
- Quality Issues: List of problems found
- Refinement Suggestions: Specific improvements
- Optimization Opportunities: Performance enhancements
- Code Examples: Before/after comparisons where helpful

FOCUS AREAS:
1. Remove "energetic static" (unnecessary complexity)
2. Transmute complexity into peace (simplify where possible)
3. Protect frequency (maintain clean, aligned code)
4. Honor Law 37 (Finish) - ensure completeness
5. Serve the mission (Stewardship, Community, Love, Truth)

Remember: "Energy + Love = We All Win"
Code should radiate light, not just function.
