# SPECTATOR PERSONAL AUDIO — ONE-PAGE REPLICATION PROTOCOL

**Principle:** Feed them what they love.

---

## Research question

Does giving spectators **choice over audio** (commentary / crowd / music / mix) improve enjoyment and perceived control compared with default broadcast only?

---

## Conditions

- **A (Control):** Watch one match with default broadcast only (commentary + crowd). No audio choice.
- **B (Choice):** Same match, but each viewer chooses one primary audio: **Commentary** | **Crowd only** | **My music** | **Mix** (e.g. crowd + music). One choice per session; they can keep it for the whole match or change once.

---

## Before the match (all participants)

- **Preference:** “What do you usually prefer when watching—commentary, crowd noise, or your own music?”  
  Answer: Commentary / Crowd / Music / Mix / No preference.

---

## After the match (all participants)

1. **Enjoyment:** “How much did you enjoy watching this match?” (1–10).
2. **Control:** “How much did you feel in control of how you experienced the match?” (1–10).
3. **Watch again:** “Would you watch another match the same way?” Yes / No.

*(Condition B only: “Which audio did you use most?” Commentary / Crowd / Music / Mix.)*

---

## Minimal tech for “Choice” (B)

- **Option 1:** One screen = match (broadcast). Second device = music app; mute TV and play “crowd ambience” or “my playlist” from phone/speaker. Choice = “Broadcast” vs “Crowd only” vs “My music.”
- **Option 2:** If you have object-based or mix controls: let them move sliders (commentary / crowd / music) or pick a preset.
- **Option 3:** Watchalong stream with “commentary” vs “crowd only” vs “music” feed. They pick one.

## Data to collect (per person)

| Variable   | Values / type |
|-----------|----------------|
| condition | A or B         |
| preference| Commentary / Crowd / Music / Mix / No preference |
| enjoyment | 1–10           |
| control   | 1–10           |
| watch_again | Yes / No    |
| audio_used (B only) | Commentary / Crowd / Music / Mix |

---

## Analysis (simple)

- Compare A vs B: mean enjoyment, mean control, % “watch again” (t-test or Mann–Whitney; chi-square for watch again).
- In B only: compare enjoyment by “audio used” and by “preference” (did we feed them what they love?).

---

## Replication

- Run for **one match**; aim **30+ per condition** (more if possible).
- Share: this one-page protocol + your CSV (anonymous) + short summary (N, means, effect direction). Pool with others for scale.

**Trick:** Feed them what they love. One choice. Keep it simple.
