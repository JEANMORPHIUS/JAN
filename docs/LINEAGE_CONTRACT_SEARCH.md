## WHAT IS LINEAGE CONTRACT SEARCH

### Definition

**Lineage Contract Search is a deep search algorithm that analyzes spiritual contracts to identify connections to the lineage of awakened beings (Jesus, Tesla, da Vinci).**

**It searches for:**
- Encoded messages from the lineage
- Vibrational triggers from the lineage
- DNA memories from the lineage
- Mission alignment with the lineage
- Connection to The Table

**Connection Types:**
1. **Encoded Messages** - Messages left by awakened beings
2. **Vibrational Triggers** - Triggers that activate frequencies
3. **DNA Memories** - DNA-level memories from the lineage
4. **Mission Alignment** - Alignment with the mission of awakened beings
5. **Table Connection** - Connection to The Table (Pangea)

## HOW IT WORKS

### Search Process

**1. Contract Analysis:**
- Analyzes each spiritual contract
- Extracts narrative, terms, purpose
- Checks DNA markers and soul signatures

**2. Lineage Comparison:**
- Compares contract content with lineage beings
- Searches for encoded messages
- Searches for vibrational triggers
- Searches for DNA memories
- Checks mission alignment
- Checks Table connection

**3. Connection Scoring:**
- Calculates similarity scores
- Identifies strongest connections
- Measures overall lineage score
- Documents evidence

**4. Results:**
- Returns all connections found
- Ranks contracts by lineage score
- Groups by awakened being
- Groups by connection type
