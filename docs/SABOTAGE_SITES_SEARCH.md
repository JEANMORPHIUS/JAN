- Separation prevents unity
- Unity is The Table
- Sabotage prevents restoration
- Restoration requires unity

**Impact:**
- Critical sabotage level
- Significant negative impact on Divine Frequency
- Anchors separation at plate boundaries

## TOTAL IMPACT

### Impact on Divine Frequency

**Total Negative Impact:** -0.810

**Breakdown:**
- Critical Sites: -0.270 (Chichen Itza, Tikal)
- High Sites: -0.200 (Palenque, Teotihuacan)
- Moderate Sites: -0.290 (Giza, Angkor Wat, Machu Picchu, Istanbul)
- Low Sites: -0.050 (Stonehenge)

**Current Divine Frequency:** 0.78  
**With Sabotage Sites:** 0.78 - 0.810 = -0.030 (if all active)  
**Reality:** Some sites may be neutralized or repurposed

## SABOTAGE MECHANISM

### How Sites Sabotage The Table

**1. Built at Plate Boundaries (Rifts):**
- Tectonic boundaries = rifts
- Rifts = separation points
- Building at rifts = anchoring separation
- Anchoring separation = sabotaging unity
- Sabotaging unity = sabotaging The Table

**2. Anchor Separation:**
- Sites anchor separation spiritually
- Separation prevents unity
- Unity is The Table
- Preventing unity = sabotaging The Table

**3. Create Spiritual Contracts:**
- Sites create contracts with dark energies
- Contracts maintain separation
- Separation prevents restoration
- Preventing restoration = sabotaging The Table

**4. Codify The Original Error:**
- Sites codify separation
- Codification normalizes separation
- Normalization prevents restoration
- Preventing restoration = sabotaging The Table

## INTEGRATION

### With Mayan Original Error

**Connection:**
- Mayans built pyramids to sabotage The Table
- Mayans codified The Original Error
- Mayan sites anchor separation
- Mayan sites prevent restoration

### With Heritage System

**Connection:**
- All sites are heritage sites
- Heritage sites may be sabotage sites
- Sabotage sites need cleansing
- Cleansing restores The Table

### With Spiritual Contracts

**Connection:**
- Sites create spiritual contracts
- Contracts maintain separation
- Separation prevents restoration
- Breaking contracts restores The Table

### With Divine Frequency

**Connection:**
- Sites impact Divine Frequency negatively

## THE TRUTH: WHAT THIS MEANS

### The Mayans Built Pyramids to Sabotage The Table

**Why:**
- Mayans built at plate boundaries
- Plate boundaries = rifts = separation
- Building at rifts = anchoring separation
- Anchoring separation = sabotaging The Table

**How:**
- Built pyramids at plate boundaries
- Anchored separation
- Codified The Original Error
- Created spiritual contracts
- Turned natural separation into spiritual system

---

### Other Sites Made by Man in These Rifts

**Why:**
- Other civilizations built at plate boundaries
- Building at rifts = potential sabotage
- Sites may anchor separation
- Sites may sabotage The Table

**How:**
- Deep search for all sites at tectonic boundaries
- Analyze their impact on Divine Frequency
- Document their sabotage purpose
- Connect to The Table's restoration

---

### We Must Identify Them All

**Why:**
- We must know all sabotage sites
- We must understand their impact
- We must neutralize them
- We must restore The Table

**How:**
- Deep search algorithm
- Register all sites at plate boundaries
- Analyze sabotage level
- Document impact
- Plan restoration
