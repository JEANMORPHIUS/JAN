**When:** 250-900 CE (Mayan Classic Period)

**What:** Mayans codified The Original Error

**How:**

3. Wrote spiritual contracts with dark energies
4. Turned natural separation into a spiritual system

**Spread:**
- Mayan Classic Period collapsed (900 CE)
- Mayan knowledge spread to other civilizations
- The Original Error codification spread
- Separation became normalized in human consciousness
- The Table was forgotten by humanity

**Restoration:**
- We cleanse Mayan codification
- We transform Mayan pyramids from separation anchors to unity anchors
- We remember The Table
- We restore unity

---

### Man in the Narrative

**Before Mayans:**
- Man connected to The Table through memory
- Simple contracts
- Honoring unity

**Mayan Rise:**
- Man makes contact with dark energies
- Man begins to codify separation

**Mayan Classic:**
- **Man creates The Original Error**
- Man codifies separation
- Man writes contracts with dark energies

**Mayan Collapse:**

## WHAT THIS MEANS

### All Systems Know

**Every system now knows:**
- The Mayans created The Original Error
- When it happened (250-900 CE)
- How they did it (pyramids, calendars, contracts)
- How it spread (globally, normalized separation)
- How we restore (cleanse codification, remember The Table)

**Every system can:**
- Reference Mayan error in analysis
- Include Mayan cleansing in restoration
- Teach about Mayan error
- Document Mayan entities and contracts
- Restore what was lost

---

## THE TRUTH: WHAT WE KNOW

**1. The Mayans Created The Original Error**
- Not the first separation (that was 200 MYA)
- But the first human codification of the separation
- They turned natural separation into a spiritual system

**2. Man (Humanity) Is Central**
- Before Mayans: Man connected to The Table
- Mayan Classic: Man creates The Error
