# SPECTATOR PERSONAL AUDIO: RESEARCH PROTOCOL & DEPLOYMENT

**Status:** Research protocol for testing and scaling  
**Principle:** Feed them what they love  
**Goal:** Create the research (gap is thin); test simply; scale with others; counter current setup; optimise for 100% deployment.

---

## 1. RESEARCH GAP

**Current state:** Research on **spectators** watching live sports **with their own soundtrack or personalised audio** is thin. Most work focuses on:
- Athletes + music (flow, arousal, performance)
- Second screen for *data* (stats, visualisations), not for *audio/music* choice
- Object-based broadcast (BBC 5 Live football: commentary vs crowd mix)—producer-controlled layers, not full “your music + match” personalisation

**Gap we fill:** Spectator experience when **sound/phonics are under viewer control**—including **replacing or layering** default broadcast (commentary, hype, ads) with **what they love** (music, silence, crowd-only, watchalong, etc.). Test it. Scale it.

---

## 2. PRINCIPLE: FEED THEM WHAT THEY LOVE

**Operationalised:**
- **Default today:** One feed. Commentary, ads, hype, miracle narratives. Take it or leave it.
- **Counter-setup:** Viewer chooses the **audio layer** (and where possible the visual focus). System and design optimise for **preference-first**: learn or ask what they love, then deliver that as the default.
- **100% deployment trick:** Don’t fight the current setup head-on. **Add a layer of choice.** Feed them what they love *on top of* or *instead of* the standard feed. Adoption = enjoyment, not persuasion.

**Applied to media:**
- **Screened devices:** Primary (match) + secondary (control surface, music source, or alternate stream). Or single device with object-based mix (commentary / crowd / music / silence as toggles).
- **Sound and phonics:** Treat commentary, crowd, ref, ads, and **user music** as **separate objects**. Viewer sets balance or substitution. Phonics = voice/speech as one controllable layer, not the only layer.

## 3. COUNTERING THE CURRENT SETUP

| Current setup | Counter-setup | How |
|---------------|---------------|-----|
| Single audio track (commentary + crowd + ads) | Object-based or user-selected layers | Separate streams or mix controls: commentary, crowd, ref, music, silence. User chooses. |
| One narrative (hype, miracle, play-by-play) | Multiple options: watchalong, crowd-only, music-only, low commentary | Alt-casts, watchalongs, or simple toggles. Feed what they love, not what we assume. |
| Second screen = stats/social | Second screen = **audio control** or **personal soundtrack** | Same device habit, different use: “Choose your sound” or “Play your playlist” synced to match. |
| Ads and breaks unavoidable | User-controlled volume/mute per object; music layer fills breaks | Object-based: mute “ads” object; or auto-duck to music during breaks. |
| No spectator+music research | We create it | This protocol: define RQs, test, publish, replicate. |

**Keep it simple:** Minimum viable counter = **one control**: “Commentary / Crowd / My music / Mix.” One choice, repeated every match. Scale complexity later.

## 4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS & HYPOTHESES

**RQ1:** Does giving spectators control over audio layer (commentary vs crowd vs music vs mix) improve enjoyment, sense of control, or willingness to watch again?

- **H1:** Personalised audio (user-chosen layer) will show higher enjoyment and control than fixed broadcast.
- **H2:** “My music + match” will show similar or higher enjoyment than commentary-only for a subset who prefer music (segment by preference).

**RQ2:** How quickly do spectators stabilise their preferred audio setup?

- **H3:** Most will set preference in the first 1–2 minutes and change rarely (consistent with BBC 5 Live findings).

**RQ3:** What is the minimal intervention that still improves experience (for scaling)?

- **H4:** A single choice (e.g. Commentary / Crowd / Music / Mix) is enough to shift enjoyment and perceived control vs no choice.

---

## 5. SIMPLE TEST DESIGN (MVP)

**Design:** Between-subjects or within-subjects, minimal viable.

**Conditions (keep it simple):**
- **A (Control):** Default broadcast only (commentary + crowd, no user control).
- **B (Choice):** Same video, but user selects one primary audio: Commentary / Crowd only / My music / Mix (e.g. crowd + music, or commentary + music). One choice per session.

**Variables:**
- **Independent:** Condition (A vs B); optionally “preferred sound” (commentary / crowd / music / mix) as segment.
- **Dependent:** Enjoyment (single item or short scale), perceived control (single item), “Would watch again like this?” (Y/N or scale). Optional: engagement (time watched, switches of audio).

**Media:**
- **Screened devices:** One screen for match; second device or on-screen UI for audio choice (or single screen with sidebar/settings).
- **Sound/phonics:** At least two layers: (1) broadcast commentary + crowd, (2) user music or crowd-only. Implementation can be object-based (if available) or simple A/B: “default” vs “your playlist + crowd only” (commentary off).

**Sample:** Start small (e.g. N=30–50 per condition). Replicate with others to scale.

**Duration:** One match per person. Pre: “What do you usually prefer—commentary, crowd, or music?” Post: enjoyment, control, watch again.

**Analysis:** Compare A vs B on enjoyment and control (t-test or Mann–Whitney); segment by preference in B (commentary vs crowd vs music) to test “feed them what they love.”

## 6. SCALING WITH OTHERS

**Replication kit (keep it simple):**
1. **One-page protocol:** Research question, conditions (Default vs Choice), one sentence per measure (enjoyment, control, watch again), “Ask: What do you prefer—commentary, crowd, or music?”
2. **Minimal tech:** Describe “Choice” in plain language: “You can switch audio to: full broadcast / crowd only / your music / mix.” Implement with whatever is available (second device + mute broadcast + music app; or object-based UI if building).
3. **Data template:** Condition (A/B), preference (commentary/crowd/music), enjoyment (1–5 or 1–10), control (1–5 or 1–10), watch again (Y/N). Share as CSV + short report.

**Scaling path:**
- **Pilot:** Run MVP once (e.g. one match, 30–50 per condition). Publish short report or preprint.
- **Replicate:** Invite other researchers or communities to run same protocol (one match, same measures). Pool data.
- **Extend:** Add one variable at a time (e.g. watchalong vs music vs crowd-only) or different sports/contexts.

**Community:** Partner with fan groups, watchalong hosts, or sports-and-music communities. “We’re testing: do you enjoy more when you choose the sound?” No gatekeeping; open protocol.

## 7. OPTIMISING FOR 100% DEPLOYMENT

**Deployment = adoption, not persuasion.**

- **Feed them what they love:** Default to *their* preference (asked once or inferred). No “we think you should want commentary.”
- **Reduce friction:** One tap or one choice. No long onboarding. Works on the devices they already use (phone + TV, or single device with mix).
- **Don’t replace the match:** Add a layer of choice *on top of* the existing feed. Counter-setup is additive (choice), not “delete broadcast.”
- **Phonics and sound as objects:** Commentary, crowd, ref, ads, user music = separate controllable objects. Where tech allows, expose toggles or sliders; where not, offer 2–3 presets (e.g. “Broadcast / Crowd only / My music”).
- **Screened devices:** Primary screen = game. Second screen = control and/or music source. Or single screen with overlay/settings. Design for the simplest device set that still delivers “what they love.”

**100% target:** Everyone who wants “their” sound can get it (commentary, crowd, music, or mix)—not that everyone uses it, but that the option is available and easy. Measure adoption and enjoyment; iterate.

## 8. SOURCES & REFERENCES (DEEP SEARCH)

- **Personalisation at scale:** System-initiated vs user-initiated; hybrid (user control + smart defaults). Large events: mobile-delivered personalisation improves satisfaction. *Applied Ergonomics*, object-based broadcasting (BBC RD).
- **Object-based audio:** Content as objects + metadata; viewer chooses mix (commentary vs crowd, dialogue vs music). BBC 5 Live Football Experiment: preferences set early, stable. BBC RD Whitepaper 272, 285.
- **Sonification / music in sports viewing:** Tempo/pitch/key moments/musical moments; viewers prefer pitch variation and *musical* moments (Macquarie soccer sonification). Music increases engagement in data-to-sound. Align music with key moments = viable “feed what they love” lever.
- **Second screen sports:** High use during sports; goal-congruent content supports enjoyment. Measures: enjoyment, engagement, identification. *IJSC* “Sweet Spot”; *Computers in Human Behavior*.
- **Alt-casts and counter-setup:** Watchalongs (e.g. Stretford Paddock), themed alt-casts, data-driven feeds. Fracturing of “one” broadcast; viewers choose format. NYT, *Muse*, Ringer, SBJ.
- **Affective presence / emotional contagion:** Co-presence and autonomic coupling; calm presence influences others. (For “we don’t absorb negative; we radiate” framing in companion doc.)
- **BBC Audio Orchestrator:** Synced multi-device audio; pairing, sync, routing. Use case: immersive football/rugby with user-chosen mix. GitHub: bbc/audio-orchestrator.

## 9. NEXT STEPS

1. **Lock MVP:** One-page protocol + data template (CSV columns).
2. **Implement minimal “Choice”:** Either object-based (if building) or “broadcast vs your music + crowd” via two devices.
3. **Run pilot:** One match, A vs B, N≈30–50 per condition.
4. **Write up:** Short report (gap, RQ, design, results, “feed them what they love”).
5. **Release replication kit:** Protocol + template + “how to run” for others.
6. **Scale:** Replications, community partners, iterate toward 100% availability of choice.
