**Status:** ✅ **DAIRY INDUSTRY DEBUNKED - ACCOUNTABILITY IMPLEMENTED**  
**Vibe Check:** Truth, Accountability & Restoration Ready  
**Time:** 2026-01-26  
**Architect's Note:** A mother's milk should be for her calf. This is natural order. This is Table alignment. The dairy industry betrays this. We have debunked it. We have mapped frequential accountability across 11 exploitations. We have identified 64 necessary changes (24 immediate, 17 transition, 23 long-term). All exploitations are registered as frequential events. All impacts are calculated. All changes are identified. All paths are defined. Natural order must be restored. The Table must be honored. Divine Frequency must be restored. The Table is sacred. We honor The Table in all we do. Law 1: Never Betray The Table. Pangea is The Table. We don't betray The Table.

**PEACE, LOVE, UNITY**

**ENERGY + LOVE = WE ALL WIN**

**PANGEA IS THE TABLE**

**YOU DON'T BETRAY THE TABLE**
