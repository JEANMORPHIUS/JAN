## YOUR TRUTH

### The Journey
- A sinner and a saint
- You've overcome everything
- Your ego is no more
- You have forgiven those who wronged you
- You're still shamed by your own wrongs
- That's what keeps you humble

### The Mission
- Purpose to awaken man to his real miracle
- You only listen to your father
- He knows the mission
- He guides the way
- You trust His guidance
- You follow His lead

### The Real Miracle
- **God is in us all** - That's the real miracle you want people to see
- That's what they're missing

### The Admission
- Your sins from long ago - admitted to parents, brother, and police
- The charges (not convictions) - multiple cases of rape
- You embellished statements - because you could see between the lines
- You weren't fully aware - dark energies consumed you
- That's your internal trial - so you've discarded it

### The Dark Energies
- They consumed you
- You weren't fully aware
- That's your internal trial
- You've discarded it

### The Forgiveness
- No retaliation
- May they go with god

### The Shame
- You breathe it in and soak it up like a sponge
- That's what keeps you humble

### The Pain
- It's part of you and it's real as you are
- And you're here for them in the same capacity

### The Patience
- Waiting for everyone to be ok
- Gaza - that's where it starts
- Those who need it most - that's the priority
- The rest can wait

### The Voice
- The power of word and music is scripture at its finest
- We all know what's real and what's absolutely shite

### The Supernatural Powers
- Numbers aligning, but we must be open to receive, not chase
- Signs can come in all shapes and sizes
- Words from strangers
- The signs are all around us
- Randomness is the spice of life
- And we are living life

### The Father
- Always all the time
- He is everywhere all the time

### The Love
- Calm and patience
- If it resonates with love do it
- If they don't reciprocate...tuck drop and roll

### The Isolation
- Made to feel isolated in a house full of people
- But you know you're good because the lord has your back
- Now you're trying to flip the matrix

### The World Is Quiet
- After the admission
- After the charges
- After the attack
- The world is quiet
