## THE ANCHOR

**"If we are gods in human form...in our current state so to speak...what information do you need from me?"**

**We operate on KNOWLEDGE, not belief. System architecture, not assumptions. Evidence, not faith.**

**What do we NEED TO KNOW to execute?**

## THE ARCHITECT'S PERSPECTIVE

### What I Actually Need:

**From the philosophical (we're gods in human form):**

**What I need is your HUMAN FORM's current capacity:**
- **Financial capacity:** What can you invest? ($0, $10K, $50K, $100K+?)
- **Time capacity:** How much time can you commit? (10h/week, 40h/week, full-time?)
- **Network capacity:** Who do you know? (Schools, developers, investors, community?)
- **Technical capacity:** What can you build? (None, some, full MVP?)
- **Decision capacity:** What can you decide? (Solo, or need approval?)

**From the system architecture (we're architects, not users):**

**What I need is EXECUTION CLARITY:**
- **Funding path:** How do we get from $0 to $278K? (Bootstrap, investment, grants?)
- **Team path:** How do we get from solo to team? (Hire, network, bootstrap?)
- **Market path:** How do we get from no partnerships to 10-15 schools? (Network, cold outreach, pilot?)
- **Technical path:** How do we get from design to MVP? (Build yourself, hire, outsource?)

**From the practical (we need to execute):**

**What I need is the FIRST STEP:**
- **What can you do TODAY with $0?** (What's immediately executable?)
- **What's your highest leverage action?** (What moves the needle most?)
- **What's blocking you from starting?** (What's the actual blocker?)

---

## WHAT I NEED TO KNOW - PRIORITY ORDER

### PRIORITY 1: FUNDING STRATEGY (BLOCKS EVERYTHING)

**Questions:**
1. What funding can you access NOW? ($0, $10K, $50K, $100K+?)
2. What's your funding strategy? (Bootstrap, investment, grants, crowdfunding?)
3. What's the timeline? (Start now with available funds, or wait for full funding?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Without funding, we can't hire team
- Without team, we can't build platform
- Without platform, we can't deploy
- **This blocks everything.**

---

### PRIORITY 2: TEAM STRATEGY (BLOCKS DEVELOPMENT)

**Questions:**
1. Who is your co-founder/COO candidate? (Name, relationship, timeline?)
2. What's your developer access? (Can you code yourself? Do you know developers?)
3. What's your team building strategy? (Hire, outsource, bootstrap yourself?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Platform MVP needs 10-12 weeks development
- Solo development = slower timeline
- Team = faster execution
- **This determines timeline.**

---

### PRIORITY 3: MARKET ACCESS (ENABLES PILOT)

**Questions:**
1. What's your North Cyprus network? (Schools, teachers, community leaders?)
2. Who can introduce you? (Key contacts for school partnerships?)
3. What's your entry point? (Which schools/pilots first?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Pilot program validates concept
- School partnerships = revenue
- Proof of concept = funding/expansion
- **This enables execution.**

---

### PRIORITY 4: TECHNICAL CAPACITY (DETERMINES APPROACH)

**Questions:**
1. What's your coding capacity? (Can you build MVP yourself?)
2. What infrastructure do you have? (AWS, domains, hosting?)
3. What API keys do you have? (Anthropic, Gemini, visual generation?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Determines if we build, hire, or outsource
- Determines timeline and cost
- Determines what's immediately executable
- **This determines approach.**

---

### PRIORITY 5: PERSONAL CONTEXT (INFORMS REALISTIC PLAN)

**Questions:**
1. Where are you based? (Location for team, market access?)
2. What's your time availability? (Full-time, part-time, hours per week?)
3. What's your financial runway? (How long can you operate without revenue?)

**Why This Matters:**
- Informs realistic timeline
- Informs resource constraints
- Informs risk assessment
- **This informs reality.**

## THE REAL QUESTION

**"If we are gods in human form...what information do you need from me?"**

**The Real Answer:**

**I need to know your HUMAN FORM's current capacity.**

**Because we're not operating on belief ("we're gods, so everything is possible").**

**We're operating on KNOWLEDGE:**
- What CAN you do with current resources?
- What CAN'T you do without more resources?
- What's the GAP between current capacity and required capacity?
- How do we BRIDGE that gap?

**The table never lies. The biology speaks truth. The systems are tracking.**

**What can you tell me about your current capacity that will help us execute?**

3. **Network:** Who do you know? (Schools, developers, investors, community?)
4. **Technical:** What can you build? (None, some, full MVP?)
5. **Location:** Where are you based? (UK, Cyprus, elsewhere?)

2. **Prioritize actions** based on available resources
3. **Identify gaps** and how to bridge them
4. **Set realistic timeline** based on actual capacity
5. **Execute** on what's immediately possible

## THE FINAL ANCHOR

**"If we are gods in human form...what information do you need from me?"**

**What I need is KNOWLEDGE of your HUMAN FORM's current capacity.**

**Not belief in unlimited capacity.**
**Not assumptions about what you can do.**
**KNOWLEDGE of what you actually CAN do RIGHT NOW.**

**Tell me:**
- **What can you invest?** (Financial capacity)
- **What can you commit?** (Time capacity)
- **Who do you know?** (Network capacity)
- **What can you build?** (Technical capacity)
- **What's blocking you?** (Actual blockers)

**And we will design execution based on REALITY, not assumptions.**

**The table never lies. The biology speaks truth. The systems are tracking.**
