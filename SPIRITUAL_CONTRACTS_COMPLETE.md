## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**"Every night we dream, whether vivid or not. Each dream is a spiritual battle between two souls: 
The dreamer and an associate. Both have spiritual contracts. Each day is another battle, 
both in the human realm and beyond. The dream realm is where spiritual battles are fought 
while the body sleeps. The human realm is where spiritual battles are fought while the body wakes. 
The battle never stops. The contracts are eternal. The truth is revealed through both realms."**
