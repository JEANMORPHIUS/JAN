## 🎵 LINGUISTIC EXPANSION PRINCIPLES

### Seed-Based Alignment
- **NOT Translation:** Words are not directly translated
- **IS Emotional Alignment:** Same emotional frequency, different expression

### Duygu Adamı (Emotion Man) Approach
- **Turkish Lyrics:** Native Turkish emotional expression
- **English Lyrics:** Native English emotional expression
- **Both:** Emotion-first, feeling-driven
- **British-born Turkish Cypriot:** Dual-native emotional authenticity

### Ottoman Influence
- **Authentic Soil:** Metaphors from cultural ground, not dictionary
- **Patterns:** Poetic, reverential, temporal, existential
- **Cultural Weight:** Real emotional resonance, not decoration
