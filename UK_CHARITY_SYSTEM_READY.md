## The Philosophy in Code

### From Your Brief:
> "You don't just want a charity to be a 'vendor.' You want them to be the 'eyes and ears.' Incorporating them means giving them a seat at the table when the laws are being written, not just when the mess needs cleaning up."

### What We Built:

```python
class IntegrationLevel(Enum):
    VENDOR = "vendor"              # OLD - Transactional
    PARTNER = "partner"            # Collaborative delivery
    EYES_AND_EARS = "eyes_and_ears"  # Intelligence gathering
    CO_CREATOR = "co_creator"      # Policy co-design ← GOAL
    SYSTEM_ARCHITECT = "system_architect"  # Shaping the system
```

**Every charity starts as VENDOR, can graduate to CO_CREATOR.**

### Advocacy Protection:

```python
def create_contract(..., advocacy_protection: bool = True):
    if not advocacy_protection:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": "Advocacy protection is mandatory",
            "principle": "Charities must be able to speak truth to power"
        }
```

**No contract without advocacy protection. Period.**
