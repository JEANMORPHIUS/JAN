## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. Protocol of Loyalty Middleware
**Issue:** Main server (`main.py`) has Protocol of Loyalty middleware that blocks all requests
**Status:** WORKAROUND - Using standalone server without middleware
**Solution:** Need to whitelist Heritage API endpoints in `check_law_1_table_service`

### 2. Pattern Matching Precision
**Issue:** Some phrases like "no hope" don't match because pattern is "hopeless case"
**Status:** WORKING AS DESIGNED - Needs more patterns
**Solution:** Add Path C patterns (50+ additional patterns)

### 3. Missing /health Endpoint in Main API
**Issue:** Heritage API doesn't have a /health endpoint
**Status:** MINOR - Standalone server has it
**Solution:** Add health endpoint to heritage_api.py router
