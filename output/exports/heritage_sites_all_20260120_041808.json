The site is renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone construction,\n    astronomical alignments, and mysterious purpose. Some theories suggest it was a royal estate, a religious\n    sanctuary, or an astronomical observatory. The Intihuatana stone is said to have spiritual energy and\n    connection to the sun. This is the \"Shell\" - but transformation-focused, because it's an Irregular site\n    that represents the transformation from ancient wisdom to modern rediscovery. High-altitude sanctuary\n    aligned with astronomical events.\n    ",
