    <main>
        <p>376 lessons (40 Laws + 7 Divine Keys) implementing spiritual 
sovereignty through sacred covenants of honour. The Laws of Racon 
serve as the foundational operating system, ensuring every lesson 
honors the eternal covenant.

Through spiritual sovereignty and the Laws of Racon, we honor 
sacred covenants of honour across cultures, bridging communities 
to Cyprus through the eternal covenant.</p>
