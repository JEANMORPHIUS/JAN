Uncle Ray here, and today we're going to talk about something beautiful.\n\n[Pause]\n\nOur lesson today is called \"Scripture: 1 Corinthians 16:14 - love_service\" and it comes from 1 Corinthians 16:14.\n\n[Pause]\n\nMade by heart. The Bible puts it this way:\n\n\"Do everything in love.\" (1 Corinthians 16:14)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction\n\n[Slower, more thoughtful]\n\nThe important thing to remember is this: Made by heart.\n\n[Warmer, encouraging tone]\n\nNow, how can we use this in our lives? Think about how you can share love and kindness with others today.\n\n[Pause]\n\nAnd here's something for you to think about: How can you use this teaching in your life?\n\n[Warm closing]\n\nRemember, you are loved, you are valued, and you have everything you need inside you to live a beautiful life.\n\nThis is Uncle Ray Ramiz, sending you peace, love, and unity.\n\n[End]\n\n[VOICE NOTES]\n- Age group: 5-7\n- Tone: Warm, caring, wise\n- Pace: Slower, very gentle\n- Character: Turkish Dayı (uncle) - caring, wise, humble\n- Language: English (with slight warm accent acceptable)\n",
