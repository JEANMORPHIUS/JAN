## WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Documentation Completeness** ✅
**Issue:** Showing 56.1% despite all entities complete

**Root Causes:**
1. `self.documents` is a Dict - needed to iterate over `.values()`
2. Documents weren't being saved to disk
3. Documents weren't being loaded from disk
4. The Ark documents weren't being counted

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Fixed iteration: `[doc for doc in self.documents.values()]`
2. Added document saving to `_save_data()`
3. Added document loading to `_load_data()`
4. Properly count The Ark documents in completeness calculation

**Result:** Documentation completeness now accurately shows 100%
