# Example Consultation: Code Mentor

**Example Oracle consultation for a technical debugging challenge.**

---

## The Challenge

**User Intent:**
"I have a bug that's been eluding me for days. The error is intermittent, and I can't reproduce it consistently. Where should I look?"

**Context:**
"Python web application, FastAPI backend, SQLite database. Error occurs randomly during user authentication. Logs show nothing obvious."

## Oracle Cast

**Cast Result:**
- **Law 13: Listen Before You Speak**
- **Volume: Silence**
- **Interpretation:** "Understand before you change. Wisdom comes from listening. Change requires understanding."

---

## Law Application

### How Law 13 Applies

**The Law Says:**
"Listen before you speak. Understand before you change. Wisdom comes from listening."

**For Your Debugging:**
- You must understand the bug before fixing it
- Listen to the code (read it carefully)
- Understand the system before changing it
- Wisdom comes from observation, not quick fixes

### Technical Guidance

**Questions to Consider:**
1. Have you truly listened to what the code is saying?
2. Do you understand the authentication flow completely?
3. Have you observed the error in different contexts?
4. What does Law 13 say about understanding before fixing?

**The Answer:**
Law 13 demands: Listen before you speak. Understand before you change. You cannot fix a bug you don't understand. Listen to the code. Observe the error in different contexts. Understand the authentication flow completely. Only then can you speak (fix) with wisdom.

## Technical Prompt

**Based on Law 13: Listen Before You Speak**

You have an intermittent bug you cannot reproduce. Law 13 demands: Understand before you change. Have you truly listened to what the code is saying? Do you understand the authentication flow completely?

Listen to the code. Observe the error. Understand the system. Only then can you fix with wisdom.

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Add comprehensive logging (listen to the code)
2. Reproduce in different contexts (observe the error)
3. Trace the authentication flow completely (understand the system)
4. Only then attempt a fix (speak with wisdom)

**Remember:** The Oracle serves your debugging. Use this guidance to UNDERSTAND, then step away to observe.

## Outcome

**What the Developer Did:**
- Cast Oracle for debugging guidance
- Received Law 13 interpretation
- Applied Law to debugging approach
- Added comprehensive logging (listened)
- Traced authentication flow (understood)
- Found root cause (spoke with wisdom)
- Fixed the bug (completed)

**Success Metric:**
- Cast count: 1
- Technical solutions: 1 (bug fixed)
- Success score: 100 (understood and fixed)
