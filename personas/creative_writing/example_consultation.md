## The Challenge

**User Intent:**
"I'm stuck on my story's ending. My protagonist has to make a difficult choice, and I don't know which direction serves the story best."

**Context:**
"Literary fiction novel, 80,000 words, protagonist is a teacher facing a moral dilemma about reporting a student's situation."

---

## Oracle Cast

**Cast Result:**
- **Law 1: The Table Never Lies**
- **Volume: Loyalty**
- **Interpretation:** "The table, bread and salt, bonds that never expire. What is created reflects character and honor."

---

## Law Application

### How Law 1 Applies

**The Law Says:**
"The table never lies. What is created reflects character and honor."

**For Your Story:**
- Your protagonist's choice must reflect their true character
- The ending must be truthful to who the character is
- The decision must honor the character's established values
- The table (the story) cannot lie about who the character is

### Creative Guidance

**Questions to Consider:**
1. Who is your protagonist at their core?
2. What values have you established throughout the story?
3. What choice would be truthful to this character?
4. How does the ending reflect the character's honor?

**The Answer:**
The ending that serves the story best is the one that is truthful to your character. Law 1 demands authenticity. If your protagonist is a teacher who values student welfare, the choice must reflect that. The table (your story) cannot lie.

## Creative Prompt

**Based on Law 1: The Table Never Lies**

Your protagonist faces a moral dilemma. The table never lies. What choice would be truthful to who this character is? What ending would honor the character's established values?

Write the ending that reflects the character's true nature. Let the table speak truth. Let the character's honor guide the decision.

**Remember:** The Oracle serves your creativity. Use this guidance to CREATE, then step away to execute.
