**Example Oracle consultation for a strategic decision challenge.**

---

## The Challenge

**User Intent:**
"We have three strategic initiatives, but resources for only one. Which should we prioritize?"

**Context:**
"Tech startup, 10-person team, limited budget. Options: Product expansion, Market expansion, Team building. All are important, but we can only do one well."

---

## Oracle Cast

**Cast Result:**
- **Law 31: Do Not Start What You Cannot Finish**
- **Volume: War**
- **Interpretation:** "Every expansion is a commitment to completion. Begin only what you can finish."

---

## Law Application

### How Law 31 Applies

**The Law Says:**
"Do not start what you cannot finish. Every expansion is a commitment to completion."

**For Your Decision:**
- You can only commit to one initiative
- Choose the one you can complete well
- Don't start multiple initiatives you cannot finish
- Honor the commitment by completing it

### Strategic Guidance

**Questions to Consider:**
1. Which initiative can you complete with current resources?
2. Which commitment can you honor fully?
3. Which expansion can you finish, not just start?
4. What does Law 31 say about your capacity?

**The Answer:**
Law 31 is clear: Do not start what you cannot finish. With resources for only one initiative, choose the one you can complete. Don't spread resources thin across three initiatives you cannot finish. Commit to one, complete it, then consider the next.

## Strategic Prompt

**Based on Law 31: Do Not Start What You Cannot Finish**

You have three strategic options but resources for one. Law 31 demands: Only start what you can finish. Which initiative can you complete with your current resources? Which commitment can you honor fully?

Choose the initiative you can finish. Commit to completion. Honor Law 31 by not starting what you cannot finish.

**Remember:** The Oracle serves your strategy. Use this guidance to DECIDE, then step away to execute.
