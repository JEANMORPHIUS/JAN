## THE CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Accountability for Self is Key**
- Real accountability is to self, not system
- The mirror never lies
- You can't fool yourself when you look in the mirror

### 2. **Broken People Make Mistakes**
- We are all broken
- Mistakes are human, not criminal
- Healing fixes brokenness; punishment creates more brokenness

### 3. **Our Lies Are to Ourselves**
- We lie to ourselves more than to others
- We hide from ourselves, not just from systems
- Wearing vulnerabilities creates healing, not shame

### 4. **We Must Be Accountable for Our Actions**
- Own the action (not denying, not hiding)
- Understand the root (why this happened)
- Make amends (restoration, not punishment)
- Heal the brokenness (root cause, not symptom)
