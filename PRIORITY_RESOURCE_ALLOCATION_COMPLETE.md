### How Priority is Calculated

**Vulnerability Level Weight:**
- CRITICAL: 100.0 points

- LOW: 10.0 points

**Age Weight (Smallest = Highest Priority):**
- Under 5 years: +30.0 points
- Under 13 years: +20.0 points
- Under 18 years: +10.0 points

**Need Count Weight:**
- Each need: +5.0 points
- More needs = higher priority

**Total Score:**
