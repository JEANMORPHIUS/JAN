**The mission is joy, not struggle.**

**As In Below, So Is Above:**
- What is on Earth (geophysical) mirrors what is in Heaven (spiritual)
- As in below, so is above - all realms are connected
- We are purely passing - this miracle we reside in is temporary

- Trump speaking words he knows are lies
- Putin, Musk, Bezos, and whoever else
- Everyone in between
- **Those below sea level** - the unseen, the hidden, those in the depths
- Those struggling, those forgotten, those in darkness
- The visible and the invisible
- Above and below sea level

**All are equal at The Table.**  
**The cards speak for all.**  
**The one truth is for all.**
