# LAND REFORM AND COMMONS SYSTEM COMPLETE

## The Foundation

### One Truth
**Land is not a commodity - it is the foundation of life. No one created the land. Private ownership of land is theft from the commons. Indigenous peoples never ceded their land - it was stolen.**

### Reality Check
All land was once commons. Enclosure (privatization) was violent theft. Today, billionaires and corporations own millions of acres while people are homeless. Land speculation drives housing costs, displaces communities, and enables wealth hoarding. We can return land to collective stewardship.

### Core Principle
**Land belongs to all. Commons over private ownership. Indigenous land back. Community stewardship. No speculation or hoarding.**

---

## Current Broken System

### The Enclosure Economy
- **Billionaire land ownership**: Ted Turner (2 million acres), John Malone (2.2 million acres), Jeff Bezos (420,000 acres)
- **Corporate ownership**: 30% of US farmland owned by investors (not farmers)
- **Foreign ownership**: 40+ million acres of US land (mostly agricultural)
- **Land speculation**: Empty homes while people homeless, vacant lots while people need gardens
- **Indigenous dispossession**: 98% of Indigenous land stolen, ongoing encroachment

### What's Actually Happening
```
Reality: 100 million acres of US farmland owned by investors
Reality: Housing crisis caused by land speculation (not shortage)
Reality: Empty homes outnumber homeless people 6:1
Reality: Billionaires buying land as climate havens
Reality: Indigenous people forced off ancestral lands
Reality: Communities displaced by gentrification
Reality: Young people cannot afford land/homes
Reality: Farmers cannot afford farmland (renting from investors)
```

### The Harm Pattern
1. **Homeless/landless**: No access to fundamental human need
2. **Communities**: Displacement, gentrification, broken social fabric
3. **Farmers**: Cannot afford land, rent from absentee owners
4. **Indigenous peoples**: Continued theft, broken treaties, cultural erasure
5. **Environment**: Extractive use (profit maximization), not stewardship
6. **Future generations**: Land hoarded by current wealthy, unavailable to descendants

### Who Profits
- **Land speculators**: Buy cheap, hold empty, sell expensive
- **Real estate investment trusts (REITs)**: Extract rent from communities
- **Billionaires**: Land = wealth storage, tax haven
- **Developers**: Privatize commons (parks, beaches, forests)
- **Agribusiness**: Corporate ownership, factory farming

### The Lie They Tell
"Private property rights are sacred" (Ownership is recent and stolen)
"Land owners deserve profits" (They didn't create the land)
"Market allocates land efficiently" (Market creates homelessness and waste)
"Indigenous people are gone" (Still here, still fighting for land back)
"We need investors to develop land" (Communities can steward land)

---

## Why Land Should Be Commons

### The Fundamental Argument
**No human created land. It belongs to all, especially future generations. Private ownership enables hoarding, speculation, and extraction. Commons enable stewardship, access, and sustainability.**

Land provides: housing, food, water, community space, cultural connection, livelihood. Treating land as a commodity creates artificial scarcity, concentrates wealth, and destroys ecosystems. Land as commons ensures access for all.

### The Economic Reality
```
Current system extraction:
- Rent extraction: $500+ billion/year (residential landlords)
- Land speculation profits: $200+ billion/year
- Unearned land value increase: $1+ trillion/year (goes to owners, not community)

Commons system costs:
- Land trust acquisition: $500 billion (one-time, buys land from market)
- Indigenous land return: Varies (reparations justice, not "cost")
- Stewardship infrastructure: $50 billion/year

Benefits:
- Eliminate rent extraction: +$500 billion/year to residents
- Eliminate speculation: Stable housing costs
- Community land trust wealth: $2+ trillion (belongs to community, not individuals)
- Agricultural productivity: Increases (owner-operators more productive)
- Environmental stewardship: Sustainability over extraction
```

### The Moral Imperative
- Land was stolen from Indigenous peoples (justice requires return)
- No one created land (private ownership illegitimate)
- Access to land = access to life (fundamental human right)
- Future generations deserve land access (hoarding is theft from descendants)
- Earth is dying from extractive land use (stewardship required)

### What Other Models Prove
- **Community Land Trusts**: 225+ in US, permanently affordable housing
- **Zapatistas (Mexico)**: Autonomous land commons, 30+ years successful
- **Rojava (Syria)**: Communal land ownership, democratic ecology
- **Mondragon (Spain)**: Cooperative land ownership, thriving economy
- **Indigenous commons**: Thousands of years sustainable land stewardship

## Community Land Trust Details

### How They Work
1. **Land ownership**: CLT owns land permanently
2. **Building ownership**: Residents own buildings/homes
3. **Ground lease**: Residents lease land (99 years, affordable rate)
4. **Resale formula**: When sold, controlled appreciation (share gains with next buyer)
5. **Permanent affordability**: Housing affordable forever (not just first buyer)

### Governance (Tripartite Board)
- **1/3 residents**: People living in CLT housing
- **1/3 community**: Neighbors, stakeholders
- **1/3 CLT staff/experts**: Professional management

**Decisions**: Democratically made, accountable to community

### Benefits
- Permanent affordability (housing inflation eliminated)
- Community stability (no displacement)
- Wealth building for residents (build home equity, not land speculation)
- Democratic control
- Proven model (225+ CLTs in US, 40+ years successful)

### Examples
- **Champlain Housing Trust** (VT): Largest US CLT, 3,000+ homes
- **Dudley Street** (MA): Community-led development, land trust since 1988
- **Sawmill Community Land Trust** (NM): Rural CLT, affordable housing in resort town

---

## Agricultural Land Trust Details

### How They Work
1. **Trust ownership**: Agricultural land trust owns farmland
2. **Farmer lease**: Long-term (30-99 years), affordable, secure
3. **Stewardship**: Agroecological practices required
4. **No speculation**: Land removed from market permanently
5. **Succession**: Farmer can pass lease to family or farm is re-leased

### Who Gets Access
- **Young farmers**: Priority (break wealth barrier)
- **BIPOC farmers**: Reparations for land theft
- **Agroecological farmers**: Organic, regenerative practices
- **Community commitment**: Connection to local food system

### Benefits
- Affordable farmland access (lease vs. $3,000-10,000/acre purchase)
- Security (long-term lease, can't be sold out from under)
- Ecological farming (required in lease)
- Community food sovereignty
- Preserve farmland (no development)

### Examples
- **Agrarian Land Trust** (CA): Provides affordable farmland access
- **Vermont Land Trust**: Protects 600+ farms
- **Equity Trust**: National model for agricultural CLTs

---

## Indigenous Land Back Details

### What Land Back Means
- **Sovereignty**: Tribal governance and decision-making
- **Reparations**: Compensation for stolen land
- **Cultural restoration**: Access to sacred sites, traditional territories
- **Environmental justice**: Indigenous stewardship of ecosystems
- **Decolonization**: Dismantling settler colonialism

### Priority Returns
1. **Sacred sites**: Black Hills, Bears Ears, San Francisco Peaks, etc.
2. **Treaty lands**: Honor all treaties, return land defined in agreements
3. **Federal land**: Transfer to tribal sovereignty (National Parks, BLM land)
4. **Urban land**: Sogorea Te (Oakland), Duwamish (Seattle), others
5. **Stolen land**: Where possible, return to original inhabitants

### How It Happens
- **Federal action**: Legislation, executive orders
- **State/local**: Land transfers, co-management
- **Private**: Land purchase and donation (community fundraising)
- **Legal**: Treaty enforcement, court decisions
- **Movement**: Landback organizing, direct action

### Indigenous Stewardship
- **Traditional ecological knowledge**: Thousands of years of sustainable practice
- **Fire management**: Prevent megafires, promote biodiversity
- **Water protection**: Sacred duty, environmental necessity
- **Biodiversity**: Indigenous lands have highest biodiversity
- **Climate**: Indigenous territories store 80% of world's biodiversity

---

## Land Value Tax Details

### How It Works
- **Tax land value**: Based on location value (not improvements)
- **Exempt buildings**: Don't tax structures (encourages development)
- **Progressive**: Wealthy landholders pay more (have valuable land)
- **Captures unearned value**: Location value created by community, belongs to community

### Effects
- **Discourages speculation**: Can't hold vacant land (tax too high)
- **Encourages use**: Develop or sell (use it or lose it via taxes)
- **Reduces housing costs**: Less speculation = lower prices
- **Generates revenue**: $500+ billion/year potential
- **Equitable**: Tax wealth, not labor

### Examples
- **Pennsylvania**: Split-rate tax (higher land, lower buildings) - success
- **Denmark**: Land value tax funds significant public services
- **Singapore**: 50% public revenue from land value
- **Hong Kong**: Land value tax funds transit, housing

---

## Cultural Transformation

### Shifting the Narrative
**From**: "Private property is sacred"
**To**: "Land is commons - belongs to all, especially Indigenous peoples"

**From**: "Landowners deserve profits"
**To**: "Land value belongs to community who creates it"

**From**: "Market allocates land efficiently"
**To**: "Commons ensure access and stewardship"

**From**: "Indigenous people are gone"
**To**: "Land Back - Indigenous sovereignty and stewardship"

**From**: "Landlords provide housing"
**To**: "Landlords extract wealth - communities provide housing"

### What This Looks Like
- Indigenous sovereignty normalized
- Community land trusts common
- Renting from community, not landlords
- Stewardship valued over ownership
- Access to land as right
- Land speculation obsolete
