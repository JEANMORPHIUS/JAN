## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Dialects Framework:**

- Dialects that are close but distinct
- Code-switching patterns across dialects
- Full timeline integration
- Deep search capabilities

**Integration:**

## THE DIALECT PRINCIPLE

### "Nearly The Same"

**The Concept:**
- People who say they "nearly" speak the same language
- Dialects that are close but not identical
- Mutual intelligibility with differences
- Code-switching between "nearly the same" languages

**Examples:**
- Turkish Cypriot / Turkish (nearly the same, but distinct)
- French / Quebec French (nearly the same, but distinct)
- British English / American English (nearly the same, but distinct)
- Cypriot Greek / Greek (nearly the same, but distinct)

**Our Application:**
- Jean Morphius: French / English (nearly the same in code-switching)
- Karasahin: Turkish / English (nearly the same in dual-native expression)
- Uncle Ray Ramiz: Turkish / English (nearly the same in teaching)
- All entities: Their dialects are "nearly the same" but distinct
