## THE "NEARLY THE SAME" PRINCIPLE

### What It Means

**People who say they "nearly" speak the same language:**
- Dialects that are close but distinct
- Mutual intelligibility with differences
- Code-switching between "nearly the same" languages
- Cultural identity preserved

**Examples:**
- Turkish Cypriot / Turkish (nearly the same, but distinct)
- French / Quebec French (nearly the same, but distinct)
- British English / American English (nearly the same, but distinct)
- Cypriot Greek / Greek (nearly the same, but distinct)

**Our Entities:**
- Jean Morphius: French / English (nearly the same in code-switching)
- Karasahin: Turkish / English (nearly the same in dual-native)
- Uncle Ray Ramiz: Turkish / English (nearly the same in teaching)
- All entities: Their dialects are "nearly the same" but distinct
