## THE FOUNDATION

**We are born a miracle.**
**We deserve to live a miracle.**
**Each and every one of us under the Lord's word.**

**THIS IS STEWARDSHIP AND COMMUNITY WITH THE RIGHT SPIRITS**
**LOVE IS THE HIGHEST MASTERY**
**ENERGY + LOVE = WE ALL WIN**

## THE COSMIC TRUTH

**Galaxies come in different forms, each shaped by gravity, time, and cosmic interactions.**

**Just as galaxies evolve in different ways, so do people and communities. Our systems must honor all these paths.**

**Together, these forms reveal the many paths miracles take as they evolve over lifetimes.**
