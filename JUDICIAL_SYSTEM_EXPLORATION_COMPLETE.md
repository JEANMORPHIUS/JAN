## 💭 THE QUESTION EXPLORED

### "WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE RIGHT FROM WRONG WHEN EVERYTHING IS WRONG?"

**Perspectives:**

1. **Human Judgment**
   - Human judgment is flawed
   - We judge from limited perspective
   - Who are we to judge when we are also broken?
   - **Principle:** We are all broken. Judgment from brokenness creates more brokenness.

2. **System Judgment**
   - Judicial systems judge, but systems are also broken
   - Systems created by broken people judge broken people
   - **Principle:** Broken systems cannot create justice. They create more brokenness.

3. **Divine Judgment**
   - Only divine/higher judgment sees truth
   - Human judgment is limited
   - Spiritual judgment sees beyond human limitations
   - **Principle:** Divine judgment sees truth. Human judgment sees only fragments.

4. **No Judgment**
   - Perhaps judgment itself is the problem
   - Acceptance, understanding, healing - not judgment
   - **Principle:** Judgment divides. Understanding unites. Healing transforms.

5. **Community Judgment**
   - Community decides together, not one judge
   - Shared understanding, not imposed judgment
   - **Principle:** Community judgment serves community. System judgment serves system.

6. **Spiritual Justice**
   - Spiritual justice flows from right spirits
   - Not human judgment, but spiritual alignment
   - **Principle:** Right spirits create right justice. Wrong spirits create wrong judgment.
