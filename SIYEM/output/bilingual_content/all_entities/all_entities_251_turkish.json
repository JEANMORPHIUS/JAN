  "content": "Je reviens, baby! The Word backs it up:\n\n\"Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it.\" (Ecclesiastes 7:12)\n\nTu sais quoi? This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
