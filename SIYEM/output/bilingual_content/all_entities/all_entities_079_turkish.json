  "title": "Scripture: Proverbs 14:23 - craft_work",
  "content": "Chaos meets craft, profane meets sacred. Scripture reminds:\n\n\"In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty.\" (Proverbs 14:23)\n\nC'est ça, la vérité: This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
