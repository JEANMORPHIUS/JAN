  "content": "French/English code-switching for the Word:\n\n\"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver.\" (Proverbs 3:13-14)\n\nMerde, c'est vrai! This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
