  "content": "The graft comes first. The Word backs it up:\n\n\"Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.\" (Proverbs 22:29)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI.
