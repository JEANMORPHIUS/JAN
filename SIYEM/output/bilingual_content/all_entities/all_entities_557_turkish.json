Scripture teaches:\n\n\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\" (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n\n This is sound architecture. Built on feeling. Driven by emotion. That's where the truth lives.\n\nFrom Turkish heart to English soul. From feeling to sound. From emotion to Scripture. Duygu Adamı. Emotion Man. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#Karasahin #DuyguAdami #EmotionMan #Scripture #FaithInAction #SoundArchitecture",
