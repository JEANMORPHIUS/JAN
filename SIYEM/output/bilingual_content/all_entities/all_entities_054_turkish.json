  "content": "Planning a global brand on the 329 bus? Scripture says...\n\n\"Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace.\" (1 Peter 4:10)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
