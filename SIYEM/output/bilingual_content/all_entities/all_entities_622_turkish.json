  "content": "Bilingual chaos meets eternal truth. Scripture tells us:\n\n\"Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans.\" (Proverbs 16:3)\n\nTu sais quoi? This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
