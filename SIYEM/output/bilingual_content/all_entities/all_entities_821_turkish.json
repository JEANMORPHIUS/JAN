  "content": "Real hands. Real work. Scripture reminds us:\n\n\"But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.\" (Romans 8:25)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
