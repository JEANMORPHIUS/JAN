  "content": "Feeling first. Sound follows. Scripture tells us:\n\n\"Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.\" (Proverbs 22:29)\n\nEmotion drives everything. This is sound architecture. Built on feeling. Driven by emotion. That's where the truth lives.\n\nFrom Turkish heart to English soul. From feeling to sound. From emotion to Scripture. Duygu Adamı. Emotion Man. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#Karasahin #DuyguAdami #EmotionMan #Scripture #FaithInAction #SoundArchitecture",
