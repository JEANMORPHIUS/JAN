  "content": "Building something real? The Word says:\n\n\"Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.\" (Galatians 6:2)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
