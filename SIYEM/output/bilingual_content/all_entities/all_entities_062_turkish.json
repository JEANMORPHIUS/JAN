  "content": "Absurd? Maybe. Profound? Always. The Bible says:\n\n\"Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.\" (Proverbs 13:20)\n\nÉcoute, mon frère: This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
