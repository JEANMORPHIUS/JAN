  "content": "Chaos meets craft, profane meets sacred. Scripture reminds:\n\n\"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.\" (Colossians 3:23)\n\nMerde, c'est vrai! This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
