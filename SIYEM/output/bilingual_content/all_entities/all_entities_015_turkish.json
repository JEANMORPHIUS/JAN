  "content": "Real hands. Real work. Scripture reminds us:\n\n\"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\" (Jeremiah 29:11)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
