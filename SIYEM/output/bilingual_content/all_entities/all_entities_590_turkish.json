  "content": "Kalpten yapıldı. The Bible puts it this way:\n\n\"Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it.\" (Ecclesiastes 7:12)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
