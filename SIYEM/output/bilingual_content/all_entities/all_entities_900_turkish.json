  "content": "French/English code-switching for the Word:\n\n\"In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty.\" (Proverbs 14:23)\n\nÉcoute, mon frère: This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Kalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
