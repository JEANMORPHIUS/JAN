  "content": "Kalpten yapıldı. The Bible puts it this way:\n\n\"By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\" (John 13:35)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nKalpten yapıldı. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
