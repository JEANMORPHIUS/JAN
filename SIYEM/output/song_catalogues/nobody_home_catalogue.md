### English Lyrics

#### Verse 1

I'm walking alone down this street again
I've been here before, It's the same now as it was back then
I'm scrambling around trying to find my way
Knowing I can't hold on to yesterday
I just hope I make it through today

#### Verse 2

The waves on the shore still call out your name
Your head on my shoulder still feels the same
If all was a lie baby you would still be true
But then I know this pictures missing you
I can't be sure I'm gonna make it through

#### Chorus

But there's nobody home on the phone to talk to
Will somebody please give me a call I'm needing something new
I give you my words, you give me your time
You give me your smile while I sing you my rhyme
That's what I want
But there's nobody home
There's nobody home
And I'm feeling so alone

#### Verse 3

It's getting harder to stay, each and every day, you're not here
But you make me stay, with the games you play, It's unclear
I'm saying where have you been, you say I'll be there by four
It's twenty to five, you're still not at my door
What can I do? I'm down on the floor
I'm waiting for you, but I can't take anymore.

#### Bridge

I'm feeling further away, but you make me stay
What can I do, all I see is you
The beat of my heart tells me this is the start
Of something beautiful of something true

#### Verse 4

Once more I'm feeling complete, standing back on my feet
Now I can see just where I want to be
Yesterday's pain won't defeat me again
I see a brand new day on the horizon
I see a brand new day on the horizon


### Turkish Lyrics

#### Verse 1

Yine aynı sokakta yürüyorum yalnız
Daha önce de buradaydım, hiç değişmemiş
Yolumu bulmaya çalışıyorum, karışık
Dünü tutamayacağımı biliyorum
Sadece bugünü atlatmayı umuyorum

#### Verse 2

Kıyıdaki dalgalar hala senin adını çağırıyor
Omzumdaki başın hala aynı hissediliyor
Her şey yalan olsa bile sen gerçek kalırsın
Ama biliyorum bu resimde sen eksiksin
Geçeceğimden emin olamıyorum

#### Chorus

Ama telefonda konuşacak kimse yok evde
Birisi lütfen beni arasın, yeni bir şeye ihtiyacım var
Sana sözlerimi veriyorum, sen bana zamanını ver
Sen bana gülümsemeni ver, ben sana şarkımı söylüyorum
İşte istediğim bu
Ama kimse yok evde
Kimse yok evde
Ve kendimi çok yalnız hissediyorum

#### Verse 3

Kalmak her geçen gün daha zorlaşıyor, sen burada değilsin
Ama sen beni kalıyorum, oynadığın oyunlarla, belirsiz
Nerede olduğunu soruyorum, dörtte orada olacağını söylüyorsun
Beşe yirmi kala, hala kapımda değilsin
Ne yapabilirim? Yerdeyim
Seni bekliyorum, ama daha fazla dayanamıyorum

#### Bridge

Daha uzakta hissediyorum, ama sen beni kalıyorum
Ne yapabilirim, gördüğüm tek şey sensin
Kalbimin atışı bana bunun başlangıç olduğunu söylüyor
Güzel bir şeyin, gerçek bir şeyin başlangıcı

#### Verse 4

Bir kez daha kendimi tam hissediyorum, ayaklarımın üzerinde duruyorum
Şimdi tam olarak nerede olmak istediğimi görebiliyorum
Dünün acısı beni tekrar yenmeyecek
Ufukta yeni bir gün görüyorum
Ufukta yeni bir gün görüyorum

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
I'm walking alone down this street again
I've been here before, It's the same now as it was back then
I'm scrambling around trying to find my way
Knowing I can't hold on to yesterday
I just hope I make it through today

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
The waves on the shore still call out your name
Your head on my shoulder still feels the same
If all was a lie baby you would still be true
But then I know this pictures missing you
I can't be sure I'm gonna make it through

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration - emotional peak)
But there's nobody home on the phone to talk to
Will somebody please give me a call I'm needing something new
I give you my words, you give me your time
You give me your smile while I sing you my rhyme
That's what I want
But there's nobody home
There's nobody home
And I'm feeling so alone

[VERSE 3]
(Frustrated, urgent, breaking down - can't take anymore)
It's getting harder to stay, each and every day, you're not here
But you make me stay, with the games you play, It's unclear
I'm saying where have you been, you say I'll be there by four
It's twenty to five, you're still not at my door
What can I do? I'm down on the floor
I'm waiting for you, but I can't take anymore.

[BRIDGE]
(Instrumental breakdown: Rhodes piano solo, Ney flute returns. 808 sub-bass drops out, leaving space. Raw, vulnerable, almost spoken.)
I'm feeling further away, but you make me stay
What can I do, all I see is you
The beat of my heart tells me this is the start
Of something beautiful of something true

[VERSE 4]
(Strong, clear, hopeful, strings brighten, 808 supportive not dominant - renewal)
Once more I'm feeling complete, standing back on my feet
Now I can see just where I want to be
Yesterday's pain won't defeat me again
I see a brand new day on the horizon
I see a brand new day on the horizon
