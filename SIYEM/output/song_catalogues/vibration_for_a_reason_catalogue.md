## 🎵 LYRICS

### English Lyrics

#### Verse 1

They say it's about vibration
That tingling sensation
Flying through the atmosphere
Finding its way here

#### Chorus

It happens for a reason
Regardless of the season
To wake up and say "Today is the day"

#### Bridge

Be it work, rest or play
Rolling in the hay
Feeling fine
Come rain or shine

#### Verse 2

So get up,
Get out
Don't make me shout
Stop picking your nose
Your brain might fall out!

#### Chorus Final

Here have a rose
Go with your flows
Maybe you're the reason
My universe chose

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
They say it's about vibration
That tingling sensation
Flying through the atmosphere
Finding its way here

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
So get up,
Get out
Don't make me shout
Stop picking your nose
Your brain might fall out!

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration - emotional peak)
It happens for a reason
Regardless of the season
To wake up and say "Today is the day"

[BRIDGE]
(Instrumental breakdown: Rhodes piano solo, Ney flute returns. 808 sub-bass drops out, leaving space. Raw, vulnerable, almost spoken.)
Be it work, rest or play
Rolling in the hay
Feeling fine
Come rain or shine
