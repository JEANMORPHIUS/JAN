## 🎵 LYRICS

### English Lyrics

#### Verse 1

Loving every flaw you have
Waiting day and night
Loving, giving all I am
Loving you

#### Chorus

Loving, like an endless film
Lifts you up then brings you down
Pulls the heart to its owner
Loving you

#### Verse 2

Living is an experience
Every new day that's born
Who will tomorrow belong to
What happens today
You stay by my side

#### Chorus Repeat

Loving, loving you
Giving life to a still heart
Loving you

#### Verse 3

You are every night's morning
You are every breath's name
Let my heart memorize you—
Loving you

#### Bridge

Let it be the writing on my forehead
Let the beginning and end be clear
Let my heart fill with you now
This life of mine, I sacrifice to you

#### Outro

Loving, loving you
Giving life to a still heart
Loving you
Loving you


### Turkish Lyrics

#### Verse 1

Senin her kusurunu sevmek
Gece gündüz beklemek
Sevmek, her olduğumu vermek
Seni sevmek

#### Chorus

Sevmek, bitmeyen filme benzer
Uçurup birden ezer
Kalp sahibine çeker
Seni sevmek

#### Verse 2

Yaşamak bir tecrübe
Her doğan yeni güne
Yarınlar kime kalır
Ne olur bugün
Sen kal yanımda

#### Chorus Repeat

Sevmek, seni sevmek
Duran kalbe can vermek
Seni sevmek

#### Verse 3

Her gecenin sabahı sensin,
Her nefesin adı sensin.
Kalbim seni ezberlesin —
Seni sevmek.

#### Bridge

Alnımdaki yazın olsun
Başı sonu belli olsun
Gönlüm artık senle dolsun
Bu canım sana feda olsun

#### Outro

Sevmek, seni sevmek
Duran kalbe can vermek
Seni sevmek
Seni sevmek

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
Loving every flaw you have
Waiting day and night
Loving, giving all I am
Loving you

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
Living is an experience
Every new day that's born
Who will tomorrow belong to
What happens today
You stay by my side

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration - emotional peak)
Loving, like an endless film
Lifts you up then brings you down
Pulls the heart to its owner
Loving you

[VERSE 3]
(Frustrated, urgent, breaking down - can't take anymore)
You are every night's morning
You are every breath's name
Let my heart memorize you—
Loving you

[BRIDGE]
(Instrumental breakdown: Rhodes piano solo, Ney flute returns. 808 sub-bass drops out, leaving space. Raw, vulnerable, almost spoken.)
Let it be the writing on my forehead
Let the beginning and end be clear
Let my heart fill with you now
This life of mine, I sacrifice to you

[OUTRO]
(Instrumental: Ney flute fades, Rhodes piano sustains. Vinyl crackle continues, memory preserved. Ambient pads create space for the horizon. 808 sub-bass fades to heartbeat.)
Loving, loving you
Giving life to a still heart
Loving you
Loving you
