## 🎵 LYRICS

### English Lyrics

#### Intro

Every man's got a corner… mine just used to talk back.

#### Hook

I don't run no more, I stand tall,
I've been down before, but I want it all.
Every bruise, every fall, made me recall —
What I am… ain't small.

#### Verse 1

Yeah… this ain't no rehab rap, this a resurrection,
Shadowboxin' my reflection, tryna pattern direction.
Heart like London concrete, cracked but it holds,
Every setback taught me how to re-write the scrolls.

Used to drown pain in a liquid belief,
But I breathe through storms now, my calm ain't brief.
Didn't pick this war, but I claimed the strain,
Turned withdrawal into wisdom, loss into gain.

Every trigger tried to pull, but I cut that chord,
Let silence answer what I once adored.
Now I walk cleaner, mind leaner, truth keener —
Used to fade to black, now the frame's clearer.

This ain't pride — this is peace reclaimed,
From chaos I carved a life unnamed.
I was my own crowd, my own corner call —
Every round survived reshaped it all.

#### Bridge

The pain that tried to drown you — became your tide,
The fight that tried to end you — kept you alive.

I ain't battlin' demons — I'm raisin' light,
Every scar's a map — how I earned my right.

Hold that line — never fold that mind,
Every loss was just a redesign.

#### Verse 2

Now I talk to temptation like, "Know your lane,"
You fed off fear, now you starve off shame.
Used to chase numb — now I chase breath,
Used to fear quiet — now I call it depth.

If pain's the teacher, then lesson learned,
I passed exams in the fire I burned.
I don't claim clean — I claim clear sight,
I tell the truth — I don't stage the fight.

Twelve rounds deep and my soul intact,
No relapse — just rematch with fact.
Tell Addiction he trained me well —
He built my hell so I could rebel.

Now I face the mirror — scarred but free,
The man I was is still rooting for me.

#### Final Hook

I don't run no more, I stand tall,
I've been down before, but I want it all.
Every bruise, every fall, made me recall —
What I am… ain't small.

Rise again, brother… we don't fall — we learn.
The twelfth round never ends.

#### Outro

The silence after the fight… that's where victory breathes.

[INTRO]
(Instrumental: Vinyl crackle, distant Ney flute, Rhodes piano enters softly. Ambient pads swell, creating space. 808 sub-bass enters subtly, heartbeat of waiting.)
Every man's got a corner… mine just used to talk back.

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
Yeah… this ain't no rehab rap, this a resurrection,
Shadowboxin' my reflection, tryna pattern direction.
Heart like London concrete, cracked but it holds,
Every setback taught me how to re-write the scrolls.

Used to drown pain in a liquid belief,
But I breathe through storms now, my calm ain't brief.
Didn't pick this war, but I claimed the strain,
Turned withdrawal into wisdom, loss into gain.

Every trigger tried to pull, but I cut that chord,
Let silence answer what I once adored.
Now I walk cleaner, mind leaner, truth keener —
Used to fade to black, now the frame's clearer.

This ain't pride — this is peace reclaimed,
From chaos I carved a life unnamed.
I was my own crowd, my own corner call —
Every round survived reshaped it all.

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
Now I talk to temptation like, "Know your lane,"
You fed off fear, now you starve off shame.
Used to chase numb — now I chase breath,
Used to fear quiet — now I call it depth.

If pain's the teacher, then lesson learned,
I passed exams in the fire I burned.
I don't claim clean — I claim clear sight,
I tell the truth — I don't stage the fight.

Twelve rounds deep and my soul intact,
No relapse — just rematch with fact.
Tell Addiction he trained me well —
He built my hell so I could rebel.

Now I face the mirror — scarred but free,
The man I was is still rooting for me.

[BRIDGE]
(Instrumental breakdown: Rhodes piano solo, Ney flute returns. 808 sub-bass drops out, leaving space. Raw, vulnerable, almost spoken.)
The pain that tried to drown you — became your tide,
The fight that tried to end you — kept you alive.

I ain't battlin' demons — I'm raisin' light,
Every scar's a map — how I earned my right.

Hold that line — never fold that mind,
Every loss was just a redesign.

[OUTRO]
(Instrumental: Ney flute fades, Rhodes piano sustains. Vinyl crackle continues, memory preserved. Ambient pads create space for the horizon. 808 sub-bass fades to heartbeat.)
The silence after the fight… that's where victory breathes.
