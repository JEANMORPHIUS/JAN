## 🎵 LYRICS

### English Lyrics

#### Verse 1

Roses are red, my heart turned gray,
My hands still reach but you slip away.
Maybe I couldn't hold your flame,
Maybe your fire is just a game.
Yesterday laughter, today I cry,
My baby don't see the tears I hide.

#### Verse 2

The pain runs deep, the wound won't mend,
The more it burns, the more I pretend.

#### Chorus

I'm in danger — falling fast,
Through shadows of a haunted past.
Losing grip, my soul untold,
No direction, no control.

#### Verse 3

I speak to mirrors, they turn their face,
Your ghost still lingers in empty space.
Whispers of you curl like smoke,
Burning my heart with words you spoke.

#### Chorus Repeat

I'm in danger — falling fast,
Through shadows of a haunted past.
Losing grip, my soul untold,
Maybe this chaos is all I hold.

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
Roses are red, my heart turned gray,
My hands still reach but you slip away.
Maybe I couldn't hold your flame,
Maybe your fire is just a game.
Yesterday laughter, today I cry,
My baby don't see the tears I hide.

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
The pain runs deep, the wound won't mend,
The more it burns, the more I pretend.

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration - emotional peak)
I'm in danger — falling fast,
Through shadows of a haunted past.
Losing grip, my soul untold,
No direction, no control.

[VERSE 3]
(Frustrated, urgent, breaking down - can't take anymore)
I speak to mirrors, they turn their face,
Your ghost still lingers in empty space.
Whispers of you curl like smoke,
Burning my heart with words you spoke.
