## 🎵 LYRICS

### English Lyrics

#### Verse 1

I chased horizons painted gold,
But every sunrise left me cold.
Whispers of power, shadows of flame,
I wore their masks, but none knew my name.

#### Verse 2

Some stay asleep, some never see,
Some fall in silence, too heavy to be.
But I kept walking, through fire, through frost,
Every mask I shed was a kingdom I lost.

#### Chorus

Through the fire, through the ice,
Through the mirrors, through the lies.
The self is a river, it cuts through the stone,
The truth is eternal — it calls me home.

#### Verse 3

I saw the seekers, blind in their fight,
I saw the dreamers, afraid of the night.
The hidden gospel carved into my skin,
The kingdom I searched for was always within.

#### Verse 4

The shadow is me, the tyrant is me,
The savior I prayed for was buried in me.
False dawns fade, but the night makes it clear,
The one I was seeking was already here.

#### Chorus Repeat

Through the fire, through the ice,
Through the silence, through the cries.
Every mask I burned was a star in the sky,
The self is eternal — it never can die.

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
I chased horizons painted gold,
But every sunrise left me cold.
Whispers of power, shadows of flame,
I wore their masks, but none knew my name.

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
Some stay asleep, some never see,
Some fall in silence, too heavy to be.
But I kept walking, through fire, through frost,
Every mask I shed was a kingdom I lost.

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration - emotional peak)
Through the fire, through the ice,
Through the mirrors, through the lies.
The self is a river, it cuts through the stone,
The truth is eternal — it calls me home.

[VERSE 3]
(Frustrated, urgent, breaking down - can't take anymore)
I saw the seekers, blind in their fight,
I saw the dreamers, afraid of the night.
The hidden gospel carved into my skin,
The kingdom I searched for was always within.

[VERSE 4]
(Strong, clear, hopeful, strings brighten, 808 supportive not dominant - renewal)
The shadow is me, the tyrant is me,
The savior I prayed for was buried in me.
False dawns fade, but the night makes it clear,
The one I was seeking was already here.
