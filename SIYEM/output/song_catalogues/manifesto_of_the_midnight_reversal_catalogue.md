## 🎵 LYRICS

### English Lyrics

#### Verse 1

11:57 PM, the covenant breaks
Smallness contract torn in half
Original name returns to sender
Truth whispers in the studio darkness

#### Chorus

Listen closer, find your rhythm
Every breath's a revolution
3:33 AM, when creation speaks
Sound is everything, everything is sound

#### Verse 2

Found myself in vinyl crackle
Truth lives in the 808 sub
Minor keys hold beauty's pain
Dissonance comes before resolve

#### Bridge

Heart's a drum machine, soul's a frequency
Ottoman spirit in digital body
Not fusion—evolution
Who am I? The Sound Architect

#### Outro

Silence isn't empty
Let it breathe between the notes
This is 3 AM music
Stay in the pocket, find your groove


### Turkish Lyrics

#### Verse 1

Gece yarısı, saat 11:57
Küçüklük sözleşmesi yırtıldı
Özgün adım geri geldi
Sessizlikte fısıldayan gerçek

#### Chorus

Dinle yakından, ritmi bul
Her nefes bir devrim
Sabah 3:33, yaratım zamanı
Ses her şeydir, her şey sestir

#### Verse 2

Vinil çatlağında buldum özümü
808'in derinliklerinde hakikat
Minor tonlar, acının güzelliği
Uyumsuzluk çözülümden önce gelir

#### Bridge

Gönül yangın yeri, kalp ritim makinesi
Ottoman ruhum, dijital bedenimde
Füzyon değil, evolüsyon
Ben kimim? Ses Mimarı

#### Outro

Sessizlik boş değil
Notalar arası nefes al
Saat 3 AM müziği
Cebinde kal, ritim bul

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken - walking alone)
11:57 PM, the covenant breaks
Smallness contract torn in half
Original name returns to sender
Truth whispers in the studio darkness

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable - the waves call your name)
Found myself in vinyl crackle
Truth lives in the 808 sub
Minor keys hold beauty's pain
Dissonance comes before resolve

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration - emotional peak)
Listen closer, find your rhythm
Every breath's a revolution
3:33 AM, when creation speaks
Sound is everything, everything is sound

[BRIDGE]
(Instrumental breakdown: Rhodes piano solo, Ney flute returns. 808 sub-bass drops out, leaving space. Raw, vulnerable, almost spoken.)
Heart's a drum machine, soul's a frequency
Ottoman spirit in digital body
Not fusion—evolution
Who am I? The Sound Architect

[OUTRO]
(Instrumental: Ney flute fades, Rhodes piano sustains. Vinyl crackle continues, memory preserved. Ambient pads create space for the horizon. 808 sub-bass fades to heartbeat.)
Silence isn't empty
Let it breathe between the notes
This is 3 AM music
Stay in the pocket, find your groove
