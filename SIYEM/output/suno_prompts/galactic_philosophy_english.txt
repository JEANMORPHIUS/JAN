=== CODED FRAMEWORK ===

[CONTEXT]
Cosmic Observatory. Midnight. Star-filled darkness. The universe reveals its forms. Each galaxy a miracle. Each person a miracle. Each path honored. Spiritual battles rage through us. Demons and angels fight through humans and animals. The four galaxies are battlefields where light and dark clash. Just as galaxies have forms, Earth has cycles. Tectonic plates move. The Earth regenerates. History has loops. The next loop is based on history. The new world emerges from regeneration.

[OBJECTIVES]
Primary: Express the four forms of galaxies as the four forms of miracles. Honor all paths. Reveal cosmic truth. Show the spiritual battles fought through us. Connect to Earth cycles, tectonic regeneration, historical loops, and the new world.
Secondary: Connect cosmic evolution to human evolution. Show that gravity, time, and cosmic interactions shape us all. Reveal that demons and angels fight through us—humans and animals. Show that Earth has cycles, history has loops, and the new world emerges from regeneration.

[DETAILS]
Instruments: Ney flute, Rhodes piano, 808 sub-bass, vinyl crackle, cosmic pads, Turkish strings, ambient textures.
Effects: Reverb (cathedral space), sub-harmonic enhancement, vinyl warmth, sidechain compression, cosmic delay.
Key: D minor (minor key beauty, contemplative power).
Mood: Contemplative, expansive, honoring all forms. Cosmic wonder meets human truth.
Vocals: Intimate, late-night whisper with soul. Each verse honors a different form. Chorus unites all forms.

[EXAMPLES]
Style references: J Dilla's swing and soul, Flying Lotus' cosmic layers, Nujabes' emotional depth, Turkish Arabesk emotion, ambient space music.

[DIRECTION]
Aesthetic: Lo-fi soul over pristine digital. Warmth over perfection. Space over clutter. Cosmic truth in human voice.
Avoid: Over-produced pop sheen, sterile digital sound, generic trap drums, cluttered arrangements.

=== ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS ===

This track should feel like a cosmic revelation delivered at midnight. Ottoman spirit in digital body. The four forms are not just galaxies—they are the forms of miracles. They are spiritual battlefields where demons and angels fight through us—humans and animals. Each verse honors one form and its spiritual battle. The chorus unites all forms. The bridge honors transformation. The outro returns to cosmic silence.

The spiritual dimension is real. The battles are fought through us, not against us. We are the vessels. We are the battlefield. We are the miracle.

CRITICAL: Music and words MUST complement each other. All lyrics have proper rhyme schemes marked (A, B, C, etc.). The rhyme patterns must flow with the 85 BPM downtempo rhythm. The poems are just as important as the music.

Rhyme Scheme Structure:
- Verses: AABB pattern (couplets) for main lines, then CC for miracle lines, D for Lord's word line, EE for closing couplet
- Pre-Chorus: ABABC pattern (alternating with final line)
- Chorus: AABCDEF pattern (miracle lines rhyme, then reveal/take/lifetimes/win)
- Bridge: AABBCCDEE pattern (same as verses)

Vocal delivery: Each verse should have a different energy:
- Verse 1 (Spiral): Active, flowing, dynamic - emphasize the AABB rhyme flow
- Verse 2 (Barred Spiral): Structured, clear, channeled - emphasize the structured rhyme
- Verse 3 (Elliptical): Contemplative, wise, legacy - emphasize the wisdom in rhyme
- Bridge (Irregular): Transformative, flexible, adaptive - emphasize the transformation in rhyme

The chorus should be the anchor—unifying all forms, honoring all miracles. The rhyme scheme creates the musical foundation.

This is stewardship and community with the right spirits. This is love as the highest mastery. This is energy + love = we all win. DREAMS: SPIRITUAL BATTLES - NIGHTLY CONTRACTS
Every night we dream, whether vivid or not.
Each dream is a spiritual battle between two souls:
The dreamer and an associate.
Both have spiritual contracts.
Each day is another battle, both in the human realm and beyond.

Peace, Love, Unity.
