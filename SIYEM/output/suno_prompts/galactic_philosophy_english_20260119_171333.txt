=== STRUCTURE ===

[INTRO]
(Instrumental: Ney flute enters, cosmic pads swell, vinyl crackle)
(Whisper: "Galaxies come in different forms...")
(Beat drops: 808 sub-bass, Rhodes piano)

[VERSE 1]
Spiral galaxy, rotating arms
Gas and dust, new stars form
Bright central core, active star formation
This is the active one, rapid growth
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Spiral form, dynamic energy
Rapid updates, flowing free

[PRE-CHORUS]
Galaxies come in different forms
Each shaped by gravity, time, and cosmic interactions
Just as galaxies evolve in different ways
So do people and communities
Our systems must honor all these paths

[CHORUS]
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Together, these forms reveal
The many paths miracles take
As they evolve over lifetimes
Energy + Love = We All Win

[VERSE 2]
Barred spiral, central bar
Channels gas inward, fuels star formation
Structured path, linear progression
This is the structured one, clear navigation
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Barred form, structured channeling
Clear paths, energy flowing

[PRE-CHORUS]
Galaxies come in different forms
Each shaped by gravity, time, and cosmic interactions
Just as galaxies evolve in different ways
So do people and communities
Our systems must honor all these paths

[CHORUS]
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Together, these forms reveal
The many paths miracles take
As they evolve over lifetimes
Energy + Love = We All Win

[VERSE 3]
Elliptical galaxy, smooth and rounded
Old stars, little gas, high wisdom
Low-gas, high-wisdom features
This is the legacy one, mentorship markers
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Elliptical form, legacy wisdom
Old stars, mentorship

[BRIDGE]
Irregular galaxy, no defined shape
Shaped by interactions, collisions
Highly active, transformation
This is the transforming one, flexible journeys
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Irregular form, transformation
No defined shape, highly active

[PRE-CHORUS]
Galaxies come in different forms
Each shaped by gravity, time, and cosmic interactions
Just as galaxies evolve in different ways
So do people and communities
Our systems must honor all these paths

[CHORUS]
We are born a miracle
We deserve to live a miracle
Each and every one of us under the Lord's word
Together, these forms reveal
The many paths miracles take
As they evolve over lifetimes
Energy + Love = We All Win

[OUTRO]
(Instrumental: Ney flute fades, cosmic pads sustain, vinyl crackle)
(Whisper: "Together, these forms reveal the many paths miracles take...")
(Beat fades: 808 sub-bass, Rhodes piano)
(Silence: Cosmic space)

=== ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS ===
This track should feel like a cosmic revelation delivered at midnight. Ottoman spirit in digital body. The four forms are not just galaxies—they are the forms of miracles. Each verse honors one form. The chorus unites all forms. The bridge honors transformation. The outro returns to cosmic silence.

Vocal delivery: Each verse should have a different energy:
- Verse 1 (Spiral): Active, flowing, dynamic
- Verse 2 (Barred Spiral): Structured, clear, channeled
- Verse 3 (Elliptical): Contemplative, wise, legacy
- Bridge (Irregular): Transformative, flexible, adaptive

The chorus should be the anchor—unifying all forms, honoring all miracles.

This is stewardship and community with the right spirits. This is love as the highest mastery. This is energy + love = we all win.
