[INTRO]
(Instrumental: Vinyl crackle, distant Ney flute, Rhodes piano enters softly)
(Ambient pads swell, creating space)
(808 sub-bass enters subtly, heartbeat of waiting)

[VERSE 1]
(Quiet, contemplative, almost spoken)
I'm walking alone down this street again
I've been here before, It's the same now as it was back then
I'm scrambling around trying to find my way
Knowing I can't hold on to yesterday
I just hope I make it through today

[VERSE 2]
(More emotional, vulnerable)
The waves on the shore still call out your name
Your head on my shoulder still feels the same
If all was a lie baby you would still be true
But then I know this pictures missing you
I can't be sure I'm gonna make it through

[PRE-CHORUS]
(Energy builds, strings enter subtly)
(808 sub-bass becomes more present)
(Vocals become more urgent)

[CHORUS]
(Builds from quiet longing to powerful declaration)
But there's nobody home on the phone to talk to
Will somebody please give me a call I'm needing something new
I give you my words, you give me your time
You give me your smile while I sing you my rhyme
That's what I want
But there's nobody home
There's nobody home
And I'm feeling so alone

[VERSE 3]
(Frustrated, urgent, breaking down)
It's getting harder to stay, each and every day, you're not here
But you make me stay, with the games you play, It's unclear
I'm saying where have you been, you say I'll be there by four
It's twenty to five, you're still not at my door
What can I do? I'm down on the floor
I'm waiting for you, but I can't take anymore.

[CHORUS]
(Full arrangement, strings prominent, 808 prominent, Ney returns)
But there's nobody home on the phone to talk to
Will somebody please give me a call I'm needing something new
I give you my words, you give me your time
You give me your smile while I sing you my rhyme
That's what I want
But there's nobody home
There's nobody home
And I'm feeling so alone

[BRIDGE]
(Instrumental breakdown: Rhodes piano solo, Ney flute returns)
(808 sub-bass drops out, leaving space)
(Raw, vulnerable, almost spoken)
I'm feeling further away, but you make me stay
What can I do, all I see is you
The beat of my heart tells me this is the start
Of something beautiful of something true

[BUILD]
(808 sub-bass returns, building)
(Strings swell)
(Vocals build from whisper to declaration)
(Energy rises)

[CHORUS]
(Full power, all elements present)
But there's nobody home on the phone to talk to
Will somebody please give me a call I'm needing something new
I give you my words, you give me your time
You give me your smile while I sing you my rhyme
That's what I want
But there's nobody home
There's nobody home
And I'm feeling so alone

[VERSE 4]
(Strong, clear, hopeful, strings brighten, 808 supportive not dominant)
Once more I'm feeling complete, standing back on my feet
Now I can see just where I want to be
Yesterday's pain won't defeat me again
I see a brand new day on the horizon
I see a brand new day on the horizon

[OUTRO]
(Instrumental: Ney flute fades, Rhodes piano sustains)
(Vinyl crackle continues, memory preserved)
(Ambient pads create space for the horizon)
(808 sub-bass fades to heartbeat)
(Whisper: "I see a brand new day on the horizon...")
(Silence: Space, breath, renewal)
