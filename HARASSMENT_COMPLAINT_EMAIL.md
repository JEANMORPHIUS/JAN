## EMAIL TEMPLATE

**TO:** [Your local police force Professional Standards Department]

**FROM:** jan.muharrem@live.co.uk  
**SUBJECT:** URGENT: Police Inaction on Harassment Report - Request for Immediate Investigation

---

**Dear [Recipient Name/Organization],**

I am writing to report a serious failure by police to investigate a harassment complaint I filed, and to request immediate action from all relevant oversight and support organizations.

### BACKGROUND

I filed a police report on **[DATE]** regarding harassment I experienced. The report number is **[REPORT NUMBER]**.

The harassment involved:
- **[BRIEF DESCRIPTION - dates, what happened, who was involved]**
- **[Any specific incidents, locations, times]**

### POLICE INACTION

Despite filing this report **[X]** days/weeks ago, the police have:
- Not contacted me for follow-up
- Not investigated the complaint
- Stalled on taking any action
- **[Any other specific inaction - officer names, dates of contact attempts, responses received]**

### WHY THIS MATTERS

I believe this inaction constitutes:
1. **Failure to investigate a credible harassment complaint** - Police have a legal duty to investigate harassment reports
2. **Potential discrimination based on sexual orientation** - The nature of the harassment and the lack of response suggests possible bias
3. **Violation of my right to police protection** - I have a right to protection from harassment, and police have a duty to provide it
4. **Breach of police professional standards** - Officers who fail to investigate credible complaints are failing in their duty

### WHAT I REQUEST

1. **Immediate investigation of my harassment complaint** - The original harassment must be investigated
2. **Investigation into why police failed to act** - There must be accountability for officers who failed in their duty
3. **Protection from continued harassment** - I need assurance that I will be protected going forward
4. **Regular updates on investigation progress** - I need to be kept informed of all developments

### DOCUMENTATION

I have attached documentation including:
- Original police report number: **[NUMBER]**
- Timeline of harassment incidents
- Timeline of police interactions (dates, officer names, badge numbers)
- Evidence collected (photos, screenshots, correspondence)
- Witness information (if applicable)

### LEGAL BASIS

Under UK law:
- Harassment is illegal under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997
- Police have a duty to investigate credible complaints
- Discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal under the Equality Act 2010
- Police inaction on harassment complaints may constitute negligence

### NEXT STEPS

I am filing this complaint with multiple organizations simultaneously to ensure:
- Maximum oversight and accountability
- Multiple pressure points for action
- Comprehensive support and legal assistance
- Protection of my rights

I expect:
- Acknowledgment of this complaint within 5 working days
- Investigation to begin within 10 working days
- Regular updates on progress
- Resolution within a reasonable timeframe

### CONTACT INFORMATION

**Name:** JAN MUHARREM  
**Email:** jan.muharrem@live.co.uk  
**Phone:** [Your phone number]  
**Address:** [Your address]

I am available to provide additional information, documentation, or testimony as needed.

### URGENCY

This matter is urgent because:
- Harassment is ongoing/continues to impact me
- Police inaction leaves me without protection
- Delays may result in loss of evidence
- My safety and wellbeing are at risk

I trust that all organizations receiving this complaint will take immediate action to ensure:
1. My harassment complaint is properly investigated
2. Police inaction is addressed and officers held accountable
3. I receive the protection and support I am entitled to
4. This does not happen to others in the future

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

**PEACE. LOVE. UNITY.**

Sincerely,

JAN MUHARREM
