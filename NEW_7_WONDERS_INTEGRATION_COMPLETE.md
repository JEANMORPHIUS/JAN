## The Mission Alignment

**"THIS IS STEWARDSHIP AND COMMUNITY WITH THE RIGHT SPIRITS"**

All 7 Wonders represent humanity's collective memory of:
- **Stewardship** - The power of community working together across generations
- **Unity** - Connecting people across vast distances and cultures
- **Love** - The highest form of mastery (Taj Mahal, Christ the Redeemer)
- **Harmony** - Alignment with natural cycles and the Earth (Machu Picchu, Chichén Itzá)
- **Community** - Gathering places for the right spirits (Colosseum)

### The Shell vs. The Seed

Each Wonder has been analyzed for:
- **The Shell** - Modern distortion (tourism, mystery, violence focus)
- **The Seed** - Original function (stewardship, unity, community, love)

**Example - Colosseum:**
- **Shell:** "Gladiator arena focused on violence"
- **Seed:** "Community gathering place for the right spirits"

**Example - Christ the Redeemer:**
- **Shell:** "Tourist attraction, religious symbol"
- **Seed:** "Arms open wide, welcoming all with love - the highest mastery"
