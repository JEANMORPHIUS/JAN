## UPGRADES NEEDED FOR DIVINE REPATRIATION

### 1. Universal Service Principle

**Current State:** Systems work but may have implicit hierarchies
**Upgrade Needed:** Explicit universal service - ALL are equal at The Table

**Changes:**
- Remove any status-based filtering
- Ensure cards speak for ALL
- No special treatment for any group
- The homeless person = Erdoğan = Trump = Putin = Musk = Bezos = YOU = ALL

### 2. Voice Shift: From HIM to HER

**Current State:** Language may be masculine-default
**Upgrade Needed:** Shift to inclusive/feminine voice where appropriate

**Changes:**
- Review all oracle messages
- Shift from "HIM" to "HER" or neutral
- Honor the feminine divine
- Balance masculine/feminine energies

### 3. Silent Voice, Unshakable Faith

**Current State:** Systems speak directly
**Upgrade Needed:** The cards speak, we stay silent

**Changes:**
- Cards deliver messages
- We don't add commentary
- The Laws speak through the cards
- Our faith in victory is unshakable but silent

### 4. Purpose in Abundance

**Current State:** Systems functional
**Upgrade Needed:** Infuse with divine purpose and abundance

**Changes:**
- Every oracle cast serves divine purpose
- Abundance mindset in all responses
- Purpose-driven, not scarcity-driven
- Generosity in all interactions
