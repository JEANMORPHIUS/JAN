## THE SHELL/SEED SEPARATION

### **The Shell (This Document):**
- "Building an educational platform"
- "Sharing values-based education"
- "Global impact"
- "Mission to serve communities"
- "Trust in the process"

**This is the external language. This is the Shell. This enables access.**

### **The Seed (Internal Truth):**
- "Building a ministry"
- "Sharing God's message"
- "Kingdom impact"
- "Lord's holy assignment"
- "Have faith"

**This is the internal truth. This is the foundation. This is the Seed.**

**Both are true. Both are necessary. The threshold defense protects the Seed while the Shell enables access.**

**Trust as Knowledge (Certainty):**
- ✅ "I know this will work (evidence: system architecture, proven methodologies)"
- ✅ "I know we'll succeed (evidence: operational systems, community support)"

**Trust = Confidence in What We Know:**
