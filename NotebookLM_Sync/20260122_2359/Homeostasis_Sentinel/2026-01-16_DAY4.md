## DATA TO COLLECT

### Immediate Priority
1. **Hydration:** ⚠️ **IMMEDIATE** - No water since morning flush, bitter/dark loop indicates dehydration
2. **Glucose:** Every 2 hours (tracking insulin response)
3. **Blood Pressure:** Daily monitoring (morning and evening)
4. **Ketones:** Check at next reading (currently unknown)
5. **Loops:** Track all loops (taste, color, context) - correlation with work/hydration
6. **Symptoms:** Any vision changes, neuropathy, breath changes?
7. **Food:** Track any food intake
8. **Pulse:** Monitor with BP readings

### Pattern Analysis
**Glucose Trend:**
- **09:50:** 30.7 mmol/L (CRITICAL)
- **13:33:** 20.8 mmol/L (IMPROVING - 32% reduction)
- **Analysis:** Insulin is working. Both Degludec and Humalog contributing to reduction.
- **Status:** Still elevated but trending in right direction.

**Insulin Response:**
- **Degludec (13 units):** Contributing (3.7 hours since dose)
- **Humalog (6 units):** Contributing (3 hours since dose)
- **Combined Effect:** Both insulin types active, glucose declining
- **Need:** Continue monitoring, may need additional short-acting at next meal

**Glucose Trend:**
- **09:50:** 30.7 mmol/L (CRITICAL)
- **13:33:** 20.8 mmol/L (IMPROVING - 32% reduction in 3.7 hours)
- **18:50:** 16.9 mmol/L (CONTINUING TO IMPROVE - 45% reduction from morning, 19% reduction from 13:33)
- **20:00 (first):** Meal + 7 units Humalog (proactive coverage for su boregi)
- **20:00 (second):** 7.9 mmol/L ✅ **NORMALIZED** (haddock + sweetcorn, no insulin)
- **00:15:** 20 mmol/L ⚠️ **ELEVATED** (153% increase from 20:00 reading) + 6 units Humalog
- **Analysis:** 
  - Morning insulin (Degludec + Humalog) successfully reduced glucose from 30.7→7.9 mmol/L over 10 hours (74% reduction) ✅
  - Evening meal (haddock + sweetcorn) without insulin coverage resulted in glucose spike 7.9→20 mmol/L over 4.25 hours ⚠️
  - Late night insulin response (6 units Humalog) administered at 00:15 ✅
- **Status:** Glucose normalized mid-evening, then elevated after meal. Insulin response initiated.

**Loop Analysis:**
- **Heavy Vibrational Work:** Since morning (correlation with loop characteristics)
- **Loop Characteristics:** Bitter taste, dark color (unexpected - expected sweet/clear)
- **Hydration Status:** Water flush continuing (addressing dehydration)
- **Correlation:** Dehydration + heavy work = concentrated, bitter, dark loop
- **Action:** Hydration ongoing - water flush continuing

**Remaining Questions:**
- Why glucose so high at wake? (Overnight elevation?)
- Did overnight loops change? (Need loop count 21:00-07:00)
- Will glucose continue to decline? (Monitor over next 2-4 hours)
- Need additional short-acting at next meal? (Assess at meal time)
- Loop correlation with hydration? (Track water intake vs loop characteristics)
