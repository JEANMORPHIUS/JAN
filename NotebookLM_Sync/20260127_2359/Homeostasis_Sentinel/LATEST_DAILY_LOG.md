## OVERNIGHT / EARLY MORNING DATA (00:00-09:00)

### Late Night Glucose Spike (00:15)
- **Time:** 00:15 (early morning Jan 17)
- **Glucose:** 20 mmol/L ⚠️ **ELEVATED**
- **Change:** Up from 7.9 mmol/L (20:00 previous day) - 153% increase over 4.25 hours
- **Time Since Meal:** 4.25 hours (20:00 → 00:15)
- **Analysis:** Significant glucose rise after evening meal (haddock + sweetcorn) without insulin coverage
- **Insulin Administration (00:15):**
  - **Humalog:** 6 units (short-acting) ✅
  - **Time:** 00:15
  - **Rationale:** Response to elevated glucose (20 mmol/L) after meal
  - **Status:** ✅ Administered
- **Beverage:** Alpro soya barista iced coffee
- **Context:** Late night beverage with insulin response to elevated glucose
- **Status:** ⚠️ Glucose elevated, insulin administered
- **Note:** Normal range 4-7 mmol/L. 20 mmol/L is 2.9-5x above normal. Insulin response initiated.

## MORNING DATA (09:00-10:00)

### Morning Glucose Check (09:00)
- **Time:** 09:00
- **Glucose:** **27.9 mmol/L** ⚠️ **CRITICALLY HIGH**
- **Change:** Up from 20 mmol/L (00:15) - 40% increase over 8.75 hours
- **Time Since Last Humalog:** 8.75 hours (00:15 → 09:00)
- **Status:** ⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED**
- **Note:** Normal range 4-7 mmol/L. This is 4-7x above normal. Glucose continued to rise overnight despite 6 units Humalog at 00:15.

### Insulin Administration (09:00)
- **Degludec:** 13 units (long-acting) ✅
- **Humalog:** 7 units (short-acting) ✅
- **Time:** 09:00
- **Total Insulin:** 20 units (13 Degludec + 7 Humalog)
- **Rationale:** Dual insulin response to critical glucose (27.9 mmol/L)
- **Status:** ✅ Both insulins administered
- **Note:** Long-acting (Degludec) for baseline control, short-acting (Humalog) for immediate glucose reduction

### Morning Flow (09:00)
- **Time:** 09:00
- **Components:**
  - Loop (urination)
  - Shilajit + Celtic Salt + Hot Water
  - Lemon Lime Flush
- **Context:** Morning ritual for hydration, mineral support, and metabolic activation
- **Status:** ✅ Morning flow completed
- **Note:** Standard morning protocol for glucose management support

## CRITICAL ANALYSIS

### Glucose Reading: 27.9 mmol/L

**This is a critical reading requiring immediate attention:**

- **Normal Range:** 4-7 mmol/L
- **Current Reading:** 27.9 mmol/L
- **Elevation:** 4-7x above normal
- **Risk Level:** ⚠️ **HIGH**

**Overnight Glucose Pattern:**
- **00:15:** 20 mmol/L (after evening meal spike)
- **09:00:** 27.9 mmol/L (continued elevation)
- **Change:** +7.9 mmol/L over 8.75 hours (40% increase)
- **Analysis:** Glucose continued to rise overnight despite 6 units Humalog at 00:15

**Possible Contributing Factors:**
1. **Insufficient Insulin Coverage:** 6 units Humalog may have been insufficient for 20 mmol/L glucose
2. **Overnight Elevation:** Glucose may have continued rising during sleep
3. **Delayed Meal Impact:** Evening meal (haddock + sweetcorn) may have had delayed glucose response
4. **Insulin Resistance:** May need higher insulin doses
5. **Long-Acting Gap:** No Degludec since previous morning (09:50 Jan 16)

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
- ✅ 13 units Degludec administered (09:00) - long-acting baseline
- ✅ 7 units Humalog administered (09:00) - short-acting response
- ✅ Morning flow completed (loop + shilajit/salt/hot water + lemon lime flush)
- ⏳ Monitor glucose response over next 2-4 hours
- ⏳ Assess insulin effectiveness

## PROTOCOL STATUS

### Hybrid Protocol (Day 5)
- **Degludec:** 13 units (09:00) - long-acting
- **Humalog:** 7 units (09:00) - short-acting
- **Total Insulin:** 20 units (13 Degludec + 7 Humalog)
- **Previous Humalog:** 6 units (00:15) - may still be active
- **CW Loops:** Continue tracking
- **Monitoring:** Every 2 hours for next 6 hours
- **Status:** ✅ Protocol active, dual insulin response to critical glucose

## DATA TO COLLECT

### Immediate Priority
1. **Glucose:** Every 2 hours (tracking insulin response to 27.9 mmol/L)
2. **Blood Pressure:** Daily monitoring (morning and evening)
3. **Ketones:** Check at next reading (elevated glucose may affect ketones)
4. **Loops:** Track all loops (taste, color, context)
5. **Symptoms:** Any vision changes, neuropathy, breath changes?
6. **Food:** Track any food intake with insulin coverage
7. **Hydration:** Continue morning flow protocol

### Pattern Analysis
**Overnight Glucose Trend:**
- **20:00 (Jan 16):** 7.9 mmol/L ✅ **NORMALIZED** (haddock + sweetcorn, no insulin)
- **00:15 (Jan 17):** 20 mmol/L ⚠️ **ELEVATED** (153% increase, 6 units Humalog)
- **09:00 (Jan 17):** 27.9 mmol/L ⚠️ **CRITICALLY HIGH** (40% increase from 00:15)
- **Analysis:** 
  - Evening meal without insulin → glucose spike (7.9→20 mmol/L)
  - 6 units Humalog at 00:15 → insufficient (glucose continued rising to 27.9)
  - Morning dual insulin (13 Degludec + 7 Humalog) → response initiated
- **Status:** ⚠️ Critical glucose elevation, aggressive insulin response needed

**Insulin Response:**
- **00:15 Humalog (6 units):** Insufficient for 20 mmol/L glucose
- **09:00 Degludec (13 units):** Long-acting baseline restoration
- **09:00 Humalog (7 units):** Short-acting response to 27.9 mmol/L
- **Combined Effect:** Dual insulin active, monitoring response
- **Need:** Continue monitoring, may need additional short-acting if glucose doesn't decline

**Remaining Questions:**
- Why did glucose continue rising after 6 units Humalog? (Insufficient dose? Insulin resistance?)
- Will dual insulin (13 Degludec + 7 Humalog) be sufficient for 27.9 mmol/L?
- Need additional short-acting at next meal? (Assess glucose response first)
- Loop correlation with high glucose? (Track taste, color, frequency)
