## DATA COLLECTION

### Metrics to Track
1. **Glucose:** Every 2 hours initially, then every 4 hours
2. **Ketones:** Morning, afternoon, evening
3. **Loops:** Every event (time, taste, notes)
4. **Symptoms:** Continuous (vision, neuropathy, breath, etc.)
5. **Food Intake:** All meals and timing
6. **Insulin Response:** Degludec effectiveness, need for short-acting

### Key Questions
- Does Degludec reduce glucose effectively?
- Does loop pattern change with insulin?
- Do ketones continue decreasing?
- Are symptoms maintained at zero?
- Is 13 units sufficient, or need adjustment?

---

## EXPECTED PATTERNS

### Degludec Response (Long-Acting)
- **Onset:** 1-2 hours
- **Peak:** 6-8 hours
- **Duration:** 24-42 hours
- **Assessment Window:** 4-6 hours for initial response

### Pomegranate Spike
- **Expected:** Glucose rise (acknowledged)
- **Monitoring:** Track magnitude and duration
- **Context:** First food with insulin + protocol

### Loop Pattern Changes
- **Possible:** Loop frequency may change
- **Possible:** Loop taste may change (less sweet if glucose drops)
- **Track:** All changes documented

---

## DECISION POINTS

### At 13:00 Assessment
1. **If glucose <300 mg/dL:** Continue monitoring, protocol working well
2. **If glucose 300-400 mg/dL:** Consider small short-acting dose (2-4 units)
3. **If glucose >400 mg/dL:** May need higher Degludec tomorrow, or short-acting now
4. **If glucose <150 mg/dL:** Reduce Degludec tomorrow (hypoglycemia risk)

### Tomorrow (Day 4)
- Review Day 3 data
- Adjust Degludec dose if needed (may need 15-18 units, or may need less)
- Continue protocol + insulin hybrid

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Insulin Response
- **Degludec (13 units):** May be insufficient - glucose remains HI
- **Total Insulin Today:** 26 units (13 Degludec + 13 Humalog)
- **Observation:** Normal Degludec dose (26 units) replaced by half-dose + short-acting
- **Need:** May need 18-20 units Degludec tomorrow, or full 26 units

### Hand Cramp Analysis
- **Timing:** 1 hour after meal (13:30, 1 hour post 12:30 meal)
- **Possible Causes:**
  1. Electrolyte imbalance (high glucose causes electrolyte shifts)
  2. Dehydration (osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia)
  3. Magnesium/potassium depletion (common with high glucose/ketones)
  4. High ketones may contribute to muscle cramps
- **Response:** Salty water = excellent self-regulation
- **Monitor:** Continue electrolyte management, watch for recurrence

### Glucose Pattern
- **08:30:** HI (baseline)
- **12:30:** HI (4 hours post-Degludec, no improvement)
- **18:30:** HI (10 hours post-Degludec, still elevated)
- **Conclusion:** Degludec dose likely too low, or significant insulin resistance

### Food Impact
- **12:30 Meal:** High-carb (strudel, custard) + protein (sucuk, eggs)
- **Response:** 7 units Humalog needed
- **Evening:** Might eat later (need to track if/when)

### Hydration Status
- **Morning:** Shilajit + Celtic salt water
- **Afternoon:** Salty water (cramp response)
- **Evening:** Water/concentrate mix
- **Status:** Good hydration awareness and management

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TOMORROW (Day 4)

### Insulin Adjustment
- **Option A:** Increase Degludec to 18-20 units (moderate increase)
- **Option B:** Return to full 26 units Degludec (normal dose)
- **Decision Factor:** Monitor tonight's glucose trend and morning ketones

### Monitoring Priority
1. **Morning Ketones:** Check at wake (currently 2.6 at 08:30)
2. **Electrolytes:** Continue salty water if cramps recur
3. **Loop Activity:** Track if frequency/taste changes
4. **Symptoms:** Watch for any recurrence of cramps or other symptoms

### Protocol Status
- **CW Loops:** Continue tracking (need loop count for today)
- **Insulin:** Continue hybrid approach (adjust dose based on data)
- **Hydration:** Maintain water/concentrate mix
- **Data Collection:** Full day 3 data valuable for pattern recognition
