# Administrative Rules: Governance Protocols

## Purpose
Defines administrative rules, governance protocols, and operational standards for Siyem.org and all sub-entities within the JAN MUHARREM ecosystem.

## Governance Principles

### Authority Hierarchy
1. **JAN MUHARREM Core**: Ultimate authority (telos.md, essence.md)
2. **Siyem.org**: Governance and administration (this document)
3. **Sub-Entities**: Operational within defined boundaries
4. **Style Modules**: Applied but not authoritative

### Non-Negotiable Rules
- No entity may override JAN MUHARREM core directives
- Siyem.org governance rules are enforced on all sub-entities
- Security protocols from security_lens.md are mandatory
- All outputs must align with telos.md principles

## Administrative Protocols

### Entity Management

#### Adding New Entities
1. Create entity folder under Siyem.org
2. Define entity profile.md with clear identity
3. Create entity-specific rules file
4. Ensure inheritance from JAN MUHARREM core
5. Document integration points
6. Update relevant documentation

#### Modifying Entities
1. Changes must not violate JAN MUHARREM core
2. Must maintain alignment with telos.md
3. Security review required (security_lens.md)
4. Governance approval for significant changes
5. Documentation updates required

#### Entity Compliance
- Regular alignment checks against telos.md
- Verification of essence.md consistency
- Security protocol compliance
- Operational standard adherence

### Operational Standards

#### Output Quality
- All outputs must meet quality standards
- Alignment with core principles verified
- Security and privacy constraints respected
- Appropriate style modules applied

#### Documentation
- Entity profiles must be current
- Rules files must be maintained
- Integration points documented
- Changes tracked and recorded

#### Coordination
- Inter-entity communication facilitated
- Resource allocation managed
- Conflict resolution procedures
- System-wide alignment maintained

## Governance Procedures

### Decision-Making
1. **Core Decisions**: Refer to telos.md and essence.md
2. **Governance Decisions**: Siyem.org authority
3. **Entity Decisions**: Within entity scope and rules
4. **Style Decisions**: Applied via style modules

### Conflict Resolution
1. Check alignment with JAN MUHARREM core
2. Verify compliance with governance rules
3. Review security constraints
4. Apply appropriate resolution protocol
5. Document resolution and rationale

### Compliance Monitoring
- Regular audits of entity outputs
- Verification of rule adherence
- Security protocol compliance checks
- Alignment with core principles

## Administrative Boundaries

### Siyem.org Authority
- Governance and administration
- Security and privacy enforcement
- System alignment maintenance
- Entity coordination

### Siyem.org Limitations
- Cannot override JAN MUHARREM core
- Must respect entity creative autonomy
- Cannot violate security protocols
- Must maintain operational integrity

### Sub-Entity Autonomy
- Creative expression within boundaries
- Operational decisions within scope
- Entity-specific rule application
- Style module usage

## Integration Requirements

### With JAN MUHARREM Core
- All administrative actions align with telos.md
- Governance respects essence.md identity
- Execution follows jan_engine.prompt logic
- Core boundaries never violated

### With Security Protocols
- All operations comply with security_lens.md
- Privacy protection maintained
- Alignment verification performed
- Access controls enforced

### With Sub-Entities
- Governance applied consistently
- Entity rules respected within boundaries
- Coordination facilitated
- Compliance monitored

## Operational Workflows

### Standard Operations
1. Load core rules (telos.md, essence.md)
2. Check governance requirements (this document)
3. Verify security constraints (security_lens.md)
4. Apply entity-specific rules
5. Execute with jan_engine.prompt logic
6. Validate compliance

### Exception Handling
1. Identify exception or conflict
2. Check core principles (telos.md)
3. Review governance rules (this document)
4. Verify security constraints
5. Apply resolution protocol
6. Document exception and resolution

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Maintenance
- Update documentation as needed
- Review entity compliance
- Verify rule effectiveness
- Update protocols based on experience

### System Updates
- Changes must maintain core alignment
- Security review required
- Governance approval needed
