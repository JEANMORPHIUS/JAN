## 🎺 THE ARCHITECT'S MESSAGE

*"Listen closer.*

*These seven tracks aren't random.*  
*They're a map.*  
*They're a journey.*  
*They're frequencies that heal, question, remember, transform.*

*From asking 'Where is God?' to discovering 'God was within.'*  
*From broken wings to flying anyway.*  
*From childhood silence to orchestral proclamation.*  
*From dust and smoke to scars that amplify.*

*This is not entertainment.*  
*This is transmission.*

*Sound is everything.*  
*And everything is sound.*

*The catalog is documented.*  
*The foundation is complete.*  
*The voice is ready.*

*Let's build."*
