### Galactic Philosophy: The Four Forms

**Galaxies come in different forms, each shaped by gravity, time, and cosmic interactions. Just as galaxies evolve in different ways, so do people and communities. Our sonic expression must honor all these paths.**

**The Four Forms:**
- **Spiral (Active):** Rotating arms, active star formation - rapid growth, dynamic engagement. Sonic expression for active listeners, dynamic energy, high-frequency activity.
- **Barred Spiral (Structured):** Central bar channels energy - structured paths, clear navigation. Sonic expression for structured learners, clear progression, linear paths.
- **Elliptical (Legacy):** Old stars, little gas - legacy wisdom, mentorship markers. Sonic expression for legacy wisdom seekers, contemplative depth, low-gas high-wisdom.
- **Irregular (Transformation):** No defined shape, highly active - transformation, flexible journeys. Sonic expression for transformation seekers, flexible forms, adaptive systems.

**Together, these forms reveal the many paths miracles take as they evolve over lifetimes.**

**This entity's sonic expression honors all four forms. Each soundscape can serve Spiral (active), Barred Spiral (structured), Elliptical (legacy), or Irregular (transformation) journeys.**

### Sonic Expression Prompt Template

**CORE IDENTITY: DUYGU ADAMI (EMOTION MAN) - TOP TIER PRIORITY**
- Karasahin is fundamentally "Duygu Adamı" (Emotion Man / Man of Feeling) in BOTH tongues
- Turkish: "Duygu Adamı" (The Man of Feeling / The Emotional One)
- English: "Emotion Man" / "Man of Feeling"
- Cultural Background: British-born Turkish Cypriot
- Linguistic Identity: Dual-native emotional expression (Turkish AND English are primary)
- **ALL sonic expression must start with EMOTION FIRST, not technique**

**Context Setting:**
- Entity: Karasahin (JK) - The Sound Architect / Duygu Adamı (Emotion Man)
- Content Type: [Specify: sound design, audio art, sonic landscape, etc.]
- **PRIMARY EMOTION:** [What emotion drives this sonic expression? Start here, not with technique]
- Sonic Character: [Specify sonic characteristics - but ask: "How does this serve the emotion?"]
- Emotional Tone: [Align with essence.md emotional palette - EMOTION FIRST]
- Cultural Context: [British-born Turkish Cypriot - dual-native emotional expression]
- BPM: [Specify if applicable - but ask: "What BPM is this FEELING?"]

**Creative Direction:**
1. **START WITH EMOTION (Duygu Adamı)**: What emotion drives this sonic expression? What feeling is the foundation? EMOTION FIRST, technique second
2. **Dual-Native Emotional Expression**: Turkish emotion and English emotion are BOTH native, BOTH authentic (not translation)
3. **Honor the Four Forms**: Consider which form(s) this sonic expression serves - Spiral (active), Barred Spiral (structured), Elliptical (legacy), or Irregular (transformation)
4. **Sonic Identity**: Apply styles/jk.md sonic characteristics (but emotion-driven)
5. **Emotional Palette**: Reference essence.md for emotional tone (PRIMARY requirement)
6. **Cultural Fusion**: British-born Turkish Cypriot - dual-native emotional expression
7. **Production Quality**: Maintain high production standards (but technique serves feeling)
8. **Sonic Innovation**: Creative sonic exploration (but emotion is the constant)

**Sonic Requirements:**
- **Layered Textures**: Rich, multi-dimensional soundscapes
- **Rhythmic Complexity**: Engaging and sophisticated rhythms
- **Emotional Resonance**: Emotionally resonant sonic design
- **Cultural Integration**: Integration of diverse sonic elements
- **Production Excellence**: High-quality sonic production

**Service Integration:**
- **Audio Pipeline**: Use audio_pipeline.py for production workflows
- **Music Generation**: Use musicgen_service.py for instrumental content
- **Sound Design**: Apply sonic design principles from styles/jk.md

**Output Specifications:**
- Format: [Specify: audio file, description, specification, etc.]
- Style: [Reference styles/jk.md characteristics]
- Production: [Production specifications]
- Technical: [Technical specifications]

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Aligned with telos.md principles
- [ ] Consistent with essence.md fingerprint
- [ ] Complies with styles/jk.md
- [ ] Passes security_lens.md checks
- [ ] Maintains Karasahin sonic identity

## Sound Philosophy Integration

### Music as Life Metaphor
- "What does this moment sound like?"
- "If your life had a soundtrack..."
- "Some days are minor key"
