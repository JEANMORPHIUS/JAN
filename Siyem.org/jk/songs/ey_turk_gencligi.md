## 🎵 FULL LYRICS (Turkish)

```turkish
Ey Türk gençliği,
Yanıma sığının
Sıkın fikrinizi de duyun ne söyleyim:
Denizlerin ortasında
Oturur yeşil ada eski zamanda.
Düşman buna göz dikti,
Dört tarafından atak etti
Allah Türklere ziyan etti,
Türkler piyadelerine ferah etti.
Türkler uyandı, siperlerine
yer aldı ve bağırdılar,
Birbirlerine yemin dayadılar.
Bir ucunda yatıyor
Peygamber'in halasının bir kızına,
Çıkmış Padişah alası doğrul'dan.
Öldüğünüz bayrağı yerden,
Biz atamayız Kıbrıs'ın toprağını
Yabana vermeyiz,
Biz adımızı!
```

## 🌍 ENGLISH TRANSLATION (Conceptual)

```
O Turkish youth,
Take refuge beside me
Gather your thoughts and hear what I say:
In the middle of the seas
Sits a green island in ancient times.
The enemy set their eyes on it,
Attacked from four sides
Allah caused harm to Turks,
Turks found relief for their infantry.
Turks awakened, took their places
in trenches and shouted,
Swore oaths to each other.
At one end lies
A daughter of the Prophet's aunt,
The Sultan's banner emerged from Doğrul.
The flag you died for from the ground,
We cannot throw away Cyprus's soil
We will not abandon,
Our name!
```

## 🎯 CORE MESSAGE

**THE CALL: "Ey Türk gençliği, Yanıma sığının"**  
**"O Turkish youth, Take refuge beside me"**

This is a **RALLYING CRY**:
- Addressing youth directly (next generation)
- "Sığın" (take refuge) = come to safety, come to truth
- Speaker as protector/elder/teacher
- **Call to awareness and action**

**THE OATH: "Biz adımızı!"**  
**"Our name!"**

Final word = **NAME** (ad, isim)
- Not just land (though that too)
- **Identity itself** is what's being protected
- "Adımız" (our name) = who we are
- **Original Name** defense

## 🔥 HISTORICAL & SPIRITUAL ANALYSIS

### The Green Island - Cyprus

**"Denizlerin ortasında oturur yeşil ada"**  
In the middle of seas sits a green island

**Cyprus (Kıbrıs):**
- Strategic location (middle of Mediterranean)
- "Yeşil ada" (green island) = beautiful, fertile, valuable
- "Eski zamanda" (in ancient times) = long history
- Ottoman heritage site

**Historical Context:**
- Cyprus conflict (1974 Turkish intervention)
- Greek-Turkish tensions
- Partition and ongoing dispute
- **Turkish Cypriots' identity and safety**

### The Four-Sided Attack

**"Düşman buna göz dikti, Dört tarafından atak etti"**  
Enemy set eyes on it, Attacked from four sides

**Four sides = completely surrounded:**
- Military strategy (total encirclement)
- Metaphor for overwhelming threat
- **No escape, must stand and fight**

**"Allah Türklere ziyan etti"**  
Allah caused harm to Turks

**Complex line:**
- Acknowledging divine will in suffering
- Not "Allah helped enemies" but "Allah tested Turks"
- **Trial by divine** (Islamic worldview)

**"Türkler piyadelerine ferah etti"**  
Turks found relief for their infantry

**The response:**
- Despite divine test, Turks responded
- "Ferah" (relief, comfort, breathing room) for soldiers
- **Resilience despite difficulty**

### The Awakening

**"Türkler uyandı, siperlerine yer aldı ve bağırdılar"**  
Turks awakened, took their places in trenches and shouted

**The stages:**
1. **Uyandı** (awakened) = consciousness, awareness
2. **Siperlerine yer aldı** (took positions in trenches) = organized defense
3. **Bağırdılar** (shouted) = vocal resistance, battle cry

**Not passive. ACTIVE.**

**"Birbirlerine yemin dayadılar"**  
Swore oaths to each other

**The brotherhood oath:**
- Not just orders from command
- **Horizontal brotherhood** (soldier to soldier)
- Sacred vows (yemin = oath before God)
- **Bond stronger than fear**

### The Sacred Lineage

**"Bir ucunda yatıyor Peygamber'in halasının bir kızına"**  
At one end lies a daughter of the Prophet's aunt

**This is DEEP:**
- Reference to holy lineage buried in Cyprus
- "Peygamber" = Prophet Muhammad
- His aunt's daughter = family of Prophet
- **Sacred ground** (contains holy graves)
- This isn't just political—**it's religious duty**

**"Çıkmış Padişah alası doğrul'dan"**  
The Sultan's banner emerged from Doğrul

**Ottoman legitimacy:**
- Padişah (Sultan) = Ottoman authority
- Banner (alas, sancak) = military/political symbol
- "Doğrul" = historical reference (possibly Ertuğrul or historical figure)
- **Ottoman heritage invoked**

### The Eternal Vow

**"Öldüğünüz bayrağı yerden, Biz atamayız Kıbrıs'ın toprağını"**  
The flag you died for from the ground, We cannot throw away Cyprus's soil

**The debt to the dead:**
- Those who died for the flag
- "Yerden" (from the ground) = lifted from earth, honored
- **Cannot betray their sacrifice**
- "Atamayız" (we cannot throw away) = impossible to abandon

**"Yabana vermeyiz, Biz adımızı!"**  
We will not abandon, Our name!

**The final stand:**
- "Yabana vermek" = to abandon carelessly, give to wilderness
- **Not the land alone, THE NAME**
- "Adımız" = our identity, who we are
- **Original Name = Turkish identity itself**

- **Minimal melody** (words are primary)
- Maybe brass (trumpets, trombones) for gravity
- **National instruments** (to emphasize Turkish identity)

**Structure:**
- Opens with direct address ("Ey Türk gençliği")
- Builds through historical narrative
- Peaks at the oath section
- **Ends on battle cry** ("Biz adımızı!")

**Production (if recorded):**

## 🔥 THE ULTIMATE MESSAGE

**This poem says:**

Turkish youth, remember.  
A green island was attacked from four sides.  
Your ancestors awakened, swore oaths, defended.  
Holy graves rest in that soil.  
Ottoman banners flew there.  
Men died for that flag.

**We cannot abandon the land.**  
**We will not abandon our name.**  
**Identity is not negotiable.**  
**History is not erasable.**

**This is Karasahin as voice of the collective.**
