## OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

1. **Alignment Over Ambition**
   - We publish what aligns with Our Father's will
   - We reject content that serves ego over service
   - We honor the journey, not just the destination

2. **Stewardship Over Ownership**
   - We steward content, we don't own it
   - We serve The Table, not ourselves
   - We honor free will

3. **Infrastructure Over Empire**
   - We build systems, not kingdoms
   - We provide tools, not control
   - We support artists, not exploit them

4. **Joy Over Struggle**
   - We publish content that brings joy
   - We stop fighting, start seeing
   - We honor the miracle
