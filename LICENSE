ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS (IMMUTABLE):

While the code is open source and free to use, modify, and distribute, the
following ethical principles must be maintained in any implementation:

1. TRANSPARENCY: Always show the mechanism
   - Users must be able to see how randomness becomes wisdom
   - No hidden algorithms, no black boxes
   - Full disclosure of the oracle casting process

2. LIBERATION: Success = user doesn't need us
   - The goal is user empowerment, not dependency
   - Users should be able to understand and replicate the system
   - No addiction mechanics, no exploitation

3. NO EXTRACTION: Never optimize against user wellbeing
   - Never use dark patterns
   - Never exploit user psychology
   - Never optimize for engagement at the cost of wellbeing

4. SURRENDER: Relinquish control, have faith
   - Let the system serve its purpose
   - Don't force outcomes
   - Trust the process

5. ABUNDANCE: Give freely what was freely given
   - The core is free and open
   - Share improvements back to the community
   - Support those who need it most

These principles are not optional. They are the foundation upon which
the Oracle is built. Use the code however serves, but maintain these
ethical constraints in any implementation.

THE BOOK OF RACON:

The 40 Laws (Book of Racon) are included in this repository as
philosophical foundation. They are not code, but they inform all
code. They are not requirements, but they are principles. They
are not suggestions—they are the foundation.

Use them. Adapt them. But respect them.

"The old laws still hold."
