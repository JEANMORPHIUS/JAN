# Heritage Cleansing Protocol - Examples

## Universal Application

The Heritage Cleansing Protocol works for **ANY** heritage site, **ANY** region, **ANY** property type. The Berengaria Hotel was just the case study that revealed the pattern.

---

## Example 1: Berengaria Hotel (Cyprus)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "The abandoned Berengaria Hotel in Cyprus is haunted by the ghost of a merchant's wife who seeks revenge..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "The Berengaria Hotel is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple lost its symbiosis with Earth. The vibrations here are waiting for Love + Energy to flow again..."

---

## Example 2: Alhambra Palace (Spain)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "The haunted Alhambra Palace in Granada is cursed. Ghosts of Moorish princesses appear at midnight seeking vengeance..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "The Alhambra Palace is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple carries history, not horror. Every story holds both Shell (what people see) and Seed (what actually happened). The Seed here is not about victims—it's about transformation waiting to happen..."

---

## Example 3: Poveglia Island (Italy)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "Poveglia Island is the most haunted place in Italy. Abandoned plague hospital where victims still scream..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "Poveglia Island is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple carries history, not horror. We honor those who came before by offering healing, not amplifying pain. We transform tragedy into testimony, not terror..."

---

## Example 4: Château de Brissac (France)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "The cursed Château de Brissac in France is haunted by the Green Lady, a murder victim seeking revenge..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "The Château de Brissac is Waiting for Regeneration. The 'Green Lady' at dusk is not a ghost—she is the threshold signal. She appears when the property is ready to transform, not when it wants to trap. This biological temple lost its symbiosis with Earth..."

---

## Example 5: Leap Castle (Ireland)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "Leap Castle in Ireland is haunted by the Elemental, a demonic entity that terrorizes visitors. Bloody Chapel where murder victims still suffer..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "Leap Castle is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple carries history, not horror. We honor those who came before by offering healing, not amplifying pain. The vibrations here are not trapped—they are waiting for Love + Energy to flow again..."

---

## Example 6: Bhangarh Fort (India)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "Bhangarh Fort in Rajasthan is cursed and haunted. Locals say no one can spend the night here. Ghosts of a princess and her lover seek revenge..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "Bhangarh Fort is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple honors Law 41: Respect the Abandoned. We honor the silence. We don't turn it into a circus. Instead of 'Cursed Fort,' we see 'Waiting for Regeneration'..."

---

## Example 7: Ancient Temple Site (Greece)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "The abandoned temple in Delphi is haunted by ancient spirits seeking vengeance for desecration..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "The Ancient Temple in Delphi is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple lost its symbiosis with Earth. When a temple (building/property) is empty, the racon says you honor the silence; you don't turn it into a circus..."

---

## Example 8: Abandoned Railway Station (England)

**Input (Dark Energy):**
> "The abandoned railway station is haunted by ghostly passengers from a tragic train accident..."

**Output (Regeneration):**
> "The Abandoned Railway Station is Waiting for Regeneration. This biological temple carries history, not horror. Every story holds both Shell (what people see) and Seed (what actually happened). The Seed here is not about victims—it's about transformation waiting to happen..."

---

## The Pattern

**All heritage sites follow the same transformation:**

1. **Detect Dark Energy:** Revenge loops, victim focus, haunted exploitation
2. **Apply Law 41:** Respect the Abandoned - honor silence, not exploitation
3. **Generate Regeneration:** Transform "haunted" into "waiting for regeneration"
4. **Protect Family:** Keep dark energy loops out of Dashboard

## Usage

```python
from scripts.heritage_cleansing import HeritageCleanser

cleanser = HeritageCleanser()

# Works for ANY property, ANY region
examples = [
    "The haunted Berengaria Hotel in Cyprus...",
    "The cursed Alhambra Palace in Spain...",
    "The abandoned Poveglia Island in Italy...",
    "Your heritage site here..."
]

for content in examples:
    cleansed, analysis = cleanser.cleanse_content(content)
    print(f"Property: {analysis.get('source', 'unknown')}")
    print(f"Compliant: {analysis['law_41_compliant']}")
    print(f"Regeneration Applied: {analysis['requires_cleansing']}")
```

**The protocol is universal.**  
**Any heritage site. Any region. Any property type.**

**Energy + Love = We All Win.**
