## New Beginnings

**Verse 1:**
The sun breaks through the morning gray
A brand new chapter starts today
Leave the shadows far behind
A brighter future's in my mind
The past can't hold me anymore
I'm walking through an open door

**Chorus:**
This is my new beginning
A chance to start again
Leave the old behind me
And let the healing begin
This is my new beginning
A fresh start, a clean slate
I'm ready for whatever comes
This is my new beginning

**Verse 2:**
Every step I take is mine
I'm writing my own design
The road ahead is clear and wide
With hope and courage by my side
I'm not the person I was before
I'm stronger now, I want much more

**Chorus:**
This is my new beginning
A chance to start again
Leave the old behind me
And let the healing begin
This is my new beginning
A fresh start, a clean slate
I'm ready for whatever comes
This is my new beginning
