## Suno Prompt

[ELECTRONIC] [BPM: 128] [KEY: C MAJOR]

An energetic, uplifting electronic track with a driving four-on-the-floor beat. Bright, shimmering synthesizers create a euphoric atmosphere, with a catchy melodic hook that builds throughout the track. The bassline provides a solid foundation with a pulsing, rhythmic pattern. 

The arrangement starts with a filtered synth pad and gradually introduces the main melody, building energy through the verse. The chorus explodes with full instrumentation, including layered synth leads, rhythmic stabs, and a powerful kick drum. 

The breakdown section strips back to the core elements before building back up with added percussion and atmospheric effects. The track maintains high energy throughout, with subtle variations in the arrangement to keep it engaging.

Use bright, modern synthesizer sounds with a polished, professional production style. The overall feel should be celebratory and energizing, perfect for a dance floor or workout playlist.
