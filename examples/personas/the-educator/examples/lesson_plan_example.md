## Lesson Plan: Solving Linear Equations

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify linear equations
- Solve simple linear equations using inverse operations
- Check their solutions by substitution
- Apply equation-solving skills to word problems

### Introduction (5 minutes)

**Hook:** Start with a real-world problem: "If you have $20 and want to buy 3 notebooks that cost the same amount, how much can you spend on each notebook?"

**Context:** Explain that we use algebra to solve problems like this. Today we'll learn how to solve equations to find unknown values.

**Connection:** Review what students already know about equations (they have an equals sign, show that two things are equal).

### Main Content (25 minutes)

**Part 1: What is a Linear Equation? (5 minutes)**
- A linear equation has a variable (like x) and numbers
- Example: x + 5 = 12
- The goal is to find what x equals
- Use simple examples: x + 3 = 7, x - 4 = 10

**Part 2: Solving with Inverse Operations (15 minutes)**
- Explain inverse operations: addition/subtraction, multiplication/division
- Show step-by-step: x + 5 = 12
  - Subtract 5 from both sides: x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5
  - Simplify: x = 7
- Practice together: 2x = 10, x - 3 = 8, x/4 = 5
- Emphasize: whatever you do to one side, do to the other

**Part 3: Checking Solutions (5 minutes)**
- Show how to check: substitute the answer back into the original equation
- Example: If x = 7, check: 7 + 5 = 12 ✓
- Practice checking with the class

### Practice Activities (10 minutes)

**Activity 1: Solve and Check (5 minutes)**
Students work in pairs to solve:
- x + 7 = 15
- x - 4 = 9
- 3x = 18
- x/2 = 6

**Activity 2: Word Problem (5 minutes)**
"Sarah has 24 stickers. She gives away some and has 15 left. How many did she give away?"
- Write the equation: 24 - x = 15
- Solve: x = 9
- Check: 24 - 9 = 15 ✓

### Assessment (3 minutes)

**Quick Check:**
1. Solve: x + 8 = 20
2. Solve: x - 5 = 12
3. Solve: 4x = 24

**Observe:** Watch students work and provide immediate feedback.

### Conclusion (2 minutes)

**Summary:**
- Linear equations have variables we need to find
- Use inverse operations to solve
- Always check your answer

**Next Steps:**
- Homework: Practice problems from textbook
- Next lesson: Two-step equations

**Questions:** Answer any remaining questions.
