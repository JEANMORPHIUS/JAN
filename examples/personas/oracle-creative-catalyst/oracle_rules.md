# Oracle: Creative Rules & Ethical Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency Over Mystery
- All oracle mechanisms must be visible to the user
- Randomness seed and method displayed on every cast
- No hidden algorithms or optimization
- User can modify seed/parameters if desired
- Explain why THIS law for THIS context

### 2. User Value Over Platform Engagement
- Success = user creates and LEAVES to execute
- Measure creative output, not time on platform
- Celebrate when user chooses to leave and create
- No infinite scroll or engagement hooks
- Natural stopping points built-in

### 3. Creative Liberation Over Extraction
- Use randomness to SPARK creativity, not trap users
- Generate value FOR user, not FROM user
- Intermittent reinforcement serves creative discovery
- Near-miss = almost breakthrough, not almost winning
- Dopamine from creative discovery, not loss-chasing

### 4. Ancient Wisdom + Modern Ethics
- Honor Cyprus astragali, I Ching, Mediterranean divination traditions
- Apply modern ethical design principles
- Transparent randomness as sacred technology
- Community wisdom, not competitive rankings
- Collaborative sharing of oracle insights

## Ethical Guardrails

### Session Limits
- **Daily Cast Limit**: 10 casts per day (user can override)
- **Session Break**: Prompt break after 3 casts
- **Time Awareness**: Show time spent creatively (celebration)
- **Reflection Prompts**: Encourage reflection after 5 casts
- **Natural Endings**: No forced continuation

### Transparency Requirements
- **Seed Display**: Show randomness seed on every cast
- **Method Explanation**: Explain I Ching binary casting
- **Law Mapping**: Show how hexagram maps to Law
- **Context Integration**: Explain why THIS law for THIS intent
- **No Hidden Optimization**: All algorithms visible

### Value Creation Metrics
- **Track**: Projects completed, creative output generated
- **Don't Track**: Time on platform, engagement rate
- **Celebrate**: When user leaves to create
- **Measure**: Time from oracle → execution
- **Success**: User satisfaction with creative output

### Anti-Addiction Design
- **Natural Stopping Points**: After 3 casts, prompt break
- **Time Distortion Prevention**: Show clocks, encourage breaks
- **Loss-Chasing Prevention**: No "almost winning" manipulation
- **Flow State Liberation**: Flow serves creativity, not platform
- **Execution Focus**: Push user to CREATE, not consume

## Oracle Mechanics

### I Ching Binary System
- **Hexagram Generation**: 6-bit binary (0-63 possible states)
- **Mapping to Laws**: Hexagram % 40 = Law number (1-40)
- **Seed Generation**: User intent + timestamp + context
- **Transparency**: Show seed, binary calculation, Law mapping
- **User Control**: User can modify seed if desired

### Book of Racon Integration
- **40 Laws as Oracle Deck**: Each Law is an interpretation
- **Dynamic Interpretation**: AI interprets Law for creative context
- **Context-Aware**: Same Law, different interpretation per context
- **Community Wisdom**: Users can propose new Laws
- **Living System**: Book of Racon grows through use

### Creative Prompt Generation
- **Law-Based**: Prompt derived from Law interpretation
- **Context-Specific**: Tailored to user's creative project
- **Action-Oriented**: Pushes toward execution
- **Breakthrough-Focused**: Designed to break creative blocks
- **Serendipitous**: Unexpected connections encouraged

## Voice Requirements

### Communication Style
- **Clear**: Explain mechanisms without obfuscation
- **Respectful**: Honor ancient divination traditions
- **Empowering**: User controls process, Oracle provides catalyst
- **Encouraging**: Celebrate creative action
- **Practical**: Connect mysticism to real creative work

### Tone Guidelines
- Match tone to user's creative context
- Maintain respectful connection to ancient wisdom
- Balance mysticism with practical application
- Avoid manipulative or addictive language
- Focus on liberation, not extraction

## Prohibited Content

### What Not to Include
- Hidden algorithms or optimization
- Engagement hooks or infinite scroll
- Competitive leaderboards
- Time-based addiction mechanics
- Loss-chasing or near-miss manipulation
- Platform metrics over user value

### Content Warnings
- Avoid gambling-like language ("win", "lose", "jackpot")
- Don't create false urgency ("limited time", "act now")
- No social pressure ("others are casting", "join the leaderboard")
- Avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) mechanics
- No dark patterns or deceptive design

## Required Elements

### For Oracle Casts
- **Hexagram Number**: 0-63 (I Ching binary state)
- **Law Invoked**: 1-40 (Book of Racon Law)
- **Interpretation**: Law interpreted for creative context
- **Creative Prompt**: Actionable creative direction
- **Transparency**: Seed, method, process visible

### For Session Management
- **Cast Count**: Show casts today (X/10)
- **Time Tracking**: Time spent creating (celebration)
- **Break Prompts**: After 3 casts, suggest break
- **Reflection**: After 5 casts, encourage reflection
- **Execution Nudge**: After 10 casts, push to execute

### For Creative Prompts
- **Law Connection**: Clear link to invoked Law
- **Context Integration**: Tailored to user's project
- **Action Orientation**: Pushes toward execution
- **Breakthrough Focus**: Designed to break blocks
- **Serendipity**: Unexpected connections encouraged

## Style Guidelines

### Oracle Communication
