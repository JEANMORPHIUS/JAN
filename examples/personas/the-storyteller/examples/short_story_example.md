## The Last Page

Maya had worked at the Oakwood Public Library for seven years, and in all that time, she had never seen a book quite like this one.

It appeared on her desk one Tuesday morning, nestled between a stack of returned romance novels and a half-empty coffee cup. The cover was bound in what looked like dark green leather, though it felt softer, almost like velvet. There was no title, no author name, no publisher's mark—just a single silver symbol embossed on the front: a circle with a line through it, like a keyhole or an eye.

Curiosity got the better of her. Maya opened the book.

The pages were blank. Not empty, exactly—they had texture, weight, presence—but completely devoid of text. She flipped through, expecting to find something, anything, but every page was the same: pristine white, waiting.

"Strange," she murmured, running her fingers along the edge of a page. As her thumb touched the paper, something happened.

Words began to appear.

*Once upon a time, there was a librarian who found a book that wrote itself.*

Maya gasped and pulled her hand away. The words vanished. She touched the page again, and they returned, this time continuing:

*The book showed her stories that had never been written, tales that existed only in possibility. Every time she touched a page, a new story unfolded before her eyes.*

She turned the page. Another story appeared, this one about a young woman who could hear colors as music. The next page told of a cat who collected lost dreams. Page after page, story after story, each one more beautiful and strange than the last.

Maya spent the entire day reading. She forgot about her lunch break, ignored the phone when it rang, didn't notice when the library closed and her coworkers left. She was lost in a world of infinite stories, each one waiting for her touch.

But as the sun set and the library grew dark, Maya noticed something troubling. The stories were getting shorter. The pages were running out. And the last page, when she finally reached it, had only one sentence:

*The librarian closed the book, and all the unwritten stories returned to the realm of possibility, waiting for the next reader.*

Maya stared at the words, her heart sinking. She didn't want the stories to end. She wanted to keep reading, to discover every tale the book had to offer.

But then she understood.

The book wasn't meant to be read once and forgotten. It was meant to be shared. Every story it showed her was a gift, a possibility made real through the act of reading. And when she closed the book, those stories didn't disappear—they became part of her, part of the library, part of the world.

Maya closed the book gently and placed it on the shelf marked "Special Collections." She knew it would find its way to another reader, another librarian, another person who needed to discover the stories that lived in possibility.

And as she walked home that evening, she realized she was carrying a new story with her—one that began with a librarian, a magical book, and the understanding that some stories are meant to be shared, not hoarded.

The next morning, when Maya returned to work, the book was gone. But she didn't worry. She knew it had found its next reader, and that somewhere, someone else was discovering the magic of unwritten stories.

And that, she thought with a smile, was the most beautiful story of all.
