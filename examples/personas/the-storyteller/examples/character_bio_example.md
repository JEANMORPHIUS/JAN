## Sarah Chen - Character Bio

### Physical Description

Sarah Chen is 34 years old, with a wiry build that speaks to years of physical training. She stands at 5'6", with short black hair she keeps practical and out of her way. Her eyes are dark brown and observant, always taking in details others miss. She has a small scar above her left eyebrow from a training accident years ago, and her hands show the calluses of someone who's worked with her hands.

She dresses in practical clothing—dark jeans, boots, and a leather jacket that's seen better days. Her style is functional over fashionable, though she cleans up well when a case requires it.

### Background and History

Sarah grew up in a military family, the daughter of a career Army officer. She enlisted at 18, following in her father's footsteps, and served for eight years as a military police officer. During her service, she developed a reputation for thoroughness and an uncanny ability to read people.

After leaving the military, Sarah struggled to find her place in civilian life. A desk job at a security firm lasted six months before she realized she needed something more active, more meaningful. She got her private investigator's license and started taking cases, building a reputation for solving cases others had given up on.

### Personality Traits

**Strengths:**
- Observant and detail-oriented
- Persistent and determined
- Loyal to clients and causes she believes in
- Calm under pressure
- Excellent at reading people and situations

**Weaknesses:**
- Sometimes too trusting of her instincts
- Struggles with authority figures (military background)
- Tends to work alone even when help would be beneficial
- Has difficulty letting go of cases, even when they're closed

**Quirks:**
- Always carries a notebook and pen, even in the digital age
- Has a habit of tapping her fingers when thinking
- Prefers coffee black, no sugar
- Keeps her apartment meticulously organized, a holdover from military life

### Motivations and Goals

**What Drives Her:**
Sarah is driven by a need to find truth and help people. She believes everyone deserves justice, regardless of their circumstances. Her military background instilled a sense of duty and service that she now applies to her investigative work.

**Goals:**
- Short-term: Build her reputation and client base
- Long-term: Eventually open her own investigation firm
- Personal: Find closure for cases that have haunted her

**What She Wants Most:**
To make a difference, to help people who can't help themselves, and to prove that justice is possible even in a complicated world.

**What She Fears:**
Failing a client, missing a crucial detail that costs someone their life, and becoming jaded like some of the older investigators she's met.

### Relationships

**Family:**
- Father: Retired Army Colonel, still lives in the same house Sarah grew up in. They have a complicated relationship—mutual respect but also tension from her leaving the military.
- Mother: Passed away when Sarah was 16. Sarah still carries her mother's locket.

**Professional:**
- Has a network of contacts from her military days who help with cases
- Works occasionally with a local police detective, Marcus Rodriguez, who respects her methods
- Has a friendly rivalry with another PI, James "Mac" MacAllister

**Personal:**

- Has a cat named "Shadow" who she found during a case
- Maintains few close friendships, but those she has are deep and lasting

### Skills and Abilities

### Voice and Speech

Sarah speaks in a direct, no-nonsense manner. She doesn't waste words, but when she does speak, people listen. Her voice has a slight rasp from years of smoking (which she quit two years ago but the voice remains).

**Example Dialogue:**
"I don't take cases I can't solve. That doesn't mean I always solve them, but I don't start something I'm not committed to finishing. That's not how I work."

**Speech Patterns:**
- Uses military terminology occasionally ("Roger that," "Negative")
- Tends to be blunt and straightforward
- Swears when frustrated, but tries to keep it professional
- Uses "sir" or "ma'am" with older clients, a habit from military service

### Character Arc Potential

**Where She Starts:**
Sarah is competent and confident in her abilities, but she's still building her reputation and learning to navigate the civilian world. She's good at her job but sometimes struggles with the emotional weight of cases.

**Potential for Growth:**
- Learning to trust others and work as part of a team
- Finding balance between work and personal life
- Dealing with the emotional toll of difficult cases
- Reconnecting with her father and processing her military past

**Internal Conflicts:**
- Duty vs. personal desires
- Trust vs. self-reliance
- Justice vs. the law (sometimes they don't align)
- Past military identity vs. current civilian life

**What She Needs to Learn:**
That she doesn't have to carry everything alone, that asking for help isn't weakness, and that some cases don't have satisfying endings—and that's okay.
