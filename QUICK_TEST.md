## Results

### If ALL tests pass:

✅ **You're good to go!**

### If SOME tests fail:
- **Which ones failed?**
- **What happened?**
- **Share the details**

### If cursor doesn't change:
- **Test in Chrome/Edge** (not Cursor's browser)
- **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Test again**
- **If it works in Chrome → CursorBrowser limitation**
- **If it doesn't work in Chrome → Different issue**
