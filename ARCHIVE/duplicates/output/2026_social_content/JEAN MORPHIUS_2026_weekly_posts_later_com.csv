,We don't own time. We shape it. The difference? One is anxiety. The other is art. Same with glucose. Same with life.,,,,,2026-01-01 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Clocks measure. They don't control. Glucose meters measure. They don't control. You're not late. You're not broken. You're exactly where you need to be.,,,,,2026-01-08 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Routine is a cage. Rhythm is freedom. Loop protocol isn't routine—it's rhythm. One locks you in. The other sets you free. Choose rhythm.,,,,,2026-01-15 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"Presence isn't a destination. It's the journey. You're not trying to arrive at perfect glucose. You're already here, managing it.",,,,,2026-01-22 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"Patience isn't waiting. It's shaping. While others rush, you craft. While glucose spikes, you respond. That's the difference between chaos and art.",,,,,2026-01-29 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"The illusion of control? It's real. But so is the art of shaping. Glucose, ketones, loops—choose art. Always choose art.",,,,,2026-02-05 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,

,"Failure isn't the opposite of success. It's the raw material. A glucose spike? Raw material. A DKA risk? Raw material. Merde... okay, listen.",,,,,2026-02-19 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"Tu comprends pas, bro? Life's not a straight line. Glucose isn't either. It's a remix. And we're the DJ.",,,,,2026-02-26 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,

,The absurd isn't random. It's the universe's way of saying 'You're taking this too seriously.' Same with T1D. Same with life.,,,,,2026-04-02 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Bilingual isn't switching languages. It's having two souls in one body. T1D isn't a disease. It's having two bodies in one soul.,,,,,2026-04-09 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Merde... sometimes the best art comes from the messiest moments. Trust the chaos. Trust the glucose. Trust the loop.,,,,,2026-04-16 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,You're not broken. You're just in the middle of a remix. The drop is coming. The glucose will stabilize. The ketones will drop.,,,,,2026-04-23 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,The comeback isn't about proving them wrong. It's about proving yourself right. Even when biology says otherwise.,,,,,2026-04-30 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Time bends when you're creating. That's not physics. That's art. Glucose bends when you're managing. That's not control. That's art.,,,,,2026-05-07 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"Je reviens, baby. Not because I have to. Because I choose to. Even with neuropathy. Even with complications. I choose.",,,,,2026-05-14 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,The best stories aren't the ones that end well. They're the ones that keep going. Same with T1D. Same with life.,,,,,2026-05-21 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Tu comprends? The rhythm finds you when you stop forcing it. The glucose stabilizes when you stop fighting it.,,,,,2026-05-28 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Failure is just the universe's way of saying 'Try a different frequency.' Same with glucose. Same with loops.,,,,,2026-06-04 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,C'est whattt?! You thought silence was empty? Non. Silence is where the next beat lives. Where the next loop happens.,,,,,2026-06-11 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,The art isn't in the perfection. It's in the honest mess. That's where truth lives. That's where T1D lives.,,,,,2026-06-18 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Bilingual means having two ways to say 'I'm still here.' Both are true. T1D means having two bodies. Both are real.,,,,,2026-06-25 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,The comeback isn't about returning to who you were. It's about becoming who you are. With T1D. With loops. With CW state.,,,,,2026-07-02 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Time doesn't wait. But it also doesn't rush. You're the one choosing the tempo. Same with glucose. Same with loops.,,,,,2026-07-09 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"Je reviens, baby. Always. Because the story isn't over until I say it is. Not glucose. Not ketones. Me.",,,,,2026-07-16 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"The chaos isn't the enemy. The enemy is thinking you need to control everything. Glucose, ketones, loops—manage, don't control.",,,,,2026-07-23 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,"Écoute, bro — the best art comes from the moments when you thought you were done. When glucose spiked. When ketones rose.",,,,,2026-07-30 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Failure isn't the end. It's the bridge. Cross it. The other side is waiting. The glucose will stabilize. The loop will work.,,,,,2026-08-06 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Time shapes you. But you shape time. That's the dance. That's the art. Same with biology. Same with T1D.,,,,,2026-08-13 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,C'est whattt?! You thought I was gone? Non. I was just remixing the track. Managing glucose. Tracking loops. Living T1D.,,,,,2026-08-20 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,The absurd isn't chaos. It's order you haven't learned to read yet. Same with glucose patterns. Same with loop protocol.,,,,,2026-08-27 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
,Bilingual means having two homes. Both are real. Both are you. T1D means having two bodies. Both are real. Both are you.,,,,,2026-09-03 09:00:00,@JEANMORPHIUS,,,,,
