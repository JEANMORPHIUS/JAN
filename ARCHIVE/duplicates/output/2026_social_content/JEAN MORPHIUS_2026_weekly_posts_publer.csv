2026-01-01,09:00,We don't own time. We shape it. The difference? One is anxiety. The other is art. Same with glucose. Same with life.,,,Yes,,,
2026-01-08,09:00,Clocks measure. They don't control. Glucose meters measure. They don't control. You're not late. You're not broken. You're exactly where you need to be.,,,Yes,,,
2026-01-15,09:00,Routine is a cage. Rhythm is freedom. Loop protocol isn't routine—it's rhythm. One locks you in. The other sets you free. Choose rhythm.,,,Yes,,,
2026-01-22,09:00,"Presence isn't a destination. It's the journey. You're not trying to arrive at perfect glucose. You're already here, managing it.",,,Yes,,,
2026-01-29,09:00,"Patience isn't waiting. It's shaping. While others rush, you craft. While glucose spikes, you respond. That's the difference between chaos and art.",,,Yes,,,
2026-02-05,09:00,"The illusion of control? It's real. But so is the art of shaping. Glucose, ketones, loops—choose art. Always choose art.",,,Yes,,,

2026-05-28,09:00,Tu comprends? The rhythm finds you when you stop forcing it. The glucose stabilizes when you stop fighting it.,,,Yes,,,
2026-06-04,09:00,Failure is just the universe's way of saying 'Try a different frequency.' Same with glucose. Same with loops.,,,Yes,,,
2026-06-11,09:00,C'est whattt?! You thought silence was empty? Non. Silence is where the next beat lives. Where the next loop happens.,,,Yes,,,

2026-07-23,09:00,"The chaos isn't the enemy. The enemy is thinking you need to control everything. Glucose, ketones, loops—manage, don't control.",,,Yes,,,
2026-07-30,09:00,"Écoute, bro — the best art comes from the moments when you thought you were done. When glucose spiked. When ketones rose.",,,Yes,,,
2026-08-06,09:00,Failure isn't the end. It's the bridge. Cross it. The other side is waiting. The glucose will stabilize. The loop will work.,,,Yes,,,
