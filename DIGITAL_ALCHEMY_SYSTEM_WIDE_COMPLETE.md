- ✅ FastAPI middleware integration
- ✅ Immutable audit logging
- ✅ Table service validation
- ✅ Word integrity checks

**The Barred Spiral (Backend) - Structured Channeling:**
- Every function is a Protocol of Loyalty
- Serves the Table (the mission)
- Channels the energy of the Laws
- Rigid structure for the Laws
- Linear progression paths

---

### ✅ **Core Learning & Community Module (Spiral) - COMPLETE**

**Location:** `jan-studio/frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`
