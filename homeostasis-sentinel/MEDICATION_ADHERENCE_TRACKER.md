## ADHERENCE SCORING

### Calculation Method

**Formula:**
- Total medications prescribed = X
- Medications taken as prescribed = Y
- Adherence Score = (Y / X) × 100%

**Categories:**
- **90-100%:** Excellent adherence
- **80-89%:** Good adherence
- **70-79%:** Fair adherence
- **<70%:** Needs improvement

**Goal:**
- Build to 90%+ adherence
- Maintain consistency
- Track improvements
