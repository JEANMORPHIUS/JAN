# RED LIGHT CONDITIONS: Protocol Stop Criteria

**This document defines the absolute "RED LIGHT" conditions that require immediate protocol termination, regardless of code recommendations.**

---

## CRITICAL RED LIGHT CONDITIONS

### 1. Vision Clarity < 2
**Condition:** Current vision clarity drops to or below 2/10
**Action:** **STOP PROTOCOL IMMEDIATELY**
**Rationale:** Represents risk of permanent vascular or neurological damage. Vision below this threshold indicates severe osmotic pressure or metabolic crisis.

### 2. Predicted Vision < 2 (Forecast)
**Condition:** TrendForecaster predicts vision clarity < 2 within next 12 hours
**Action:** **STOP PROTOCOL IMMEDIATELY**
**Rationale:** Prevents reaching critical threshold. System breach detection.

### 3. Unconsciousness or Severe Disorientation
**Condition:** Any loss of consciousness, severe confusion, or inability to track time/place
**Action:** **STOP PROTOCOL IMMEDIATELY + SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION**
**Rationale:** Indicates severe metabolic crisis (potentially DKA). Medical emergency.

### 4. Persistent Vomiting or Inability to Hydrate
**Condition:** Unable to keep water/fluids down for >2 hours
**Action:** **STOP PROTOCOL + SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION**
**Rationale:** Risk of severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Cannot maintain basic hydration.

### 5. Severe Chest Pain or Cardiac Symptoms
**Condition:** Chest pain, irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness, or fainting
**Action:** **STOP PROTOCOL + SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION**
**Rationale:** Potential cardiac complications. Medical emergency.

## YELLOW LIGHT CONDITIONS (Prepare to Stop)

### 1. Vision Clarity < 3 for >4 hours
**Condition:** Vision remains below 3/10 for more than 4 consecutive hours despite intervention
**Action:** **PREPARE TO STOP. Monitor every 30 minutes.**
**Rationale:** Approaching critical threshold. If no improvement, proceed to RED LIGHT.

### 2. Muscle Tension > 9 for >6 hours
**Condition:** Muscle tension remains above 9/10 for more than 6 hours despite flush/clearance
**Action:** **PREPARE TO STOP. Escalate intervention.**
**Rationale:** Extreme tension indicates severe metabolic stress. System may be unable to clear acidity.

### 3. Acidosis Risk: 5+ Consecutive Days
**Condition:** High tension (>7) + low vision (<5) for 5+ consecutive days
**Action:** **PREPARE TO STOP. Consider protocol pause.**
**Rationale:** Persistent acidosis risk indicates protocol may not be sustainable at current parameters.

## USER RESPONSIBILITY

**The code provides alerts and recommendations. The user (researcher) makes the final decision.**

### Decision Framework:
1. **Trust the Hard-Deck Kill-Switch** - If forecast predicts vision < 2, STOP
2. **Trust your body** - If you feel unsafe or experience severe symptoms, STOP regardless of metrics
3. **When in doubt, STOP** - The protocol can be resumed. Permanent damage cannot be undone.
4. **Medical attention takes precedence** - If symptoms suggest medical emergency, seek help immediately

## Day 1 Morning Protocol (Go/No-Go)

### Baseline Assessment (First Entry):
1. **Sync the Clock:** First Obsidian entry = moment you see the sun
2. **Baseline Vision:** Most critical data point. Measure immediately upon waking.
   - If vision is blurred BEFORE first "Loop" → Body starting day in high osmotic pressure
   - This is a YELLOW LIGHT signal
3. **First Action Decision:**
   - If vision < 4: Consider postponing protocol start
   - If vision 4-6: Proceed with extreme caution, increase monitoring frequency
   - If vision > 6: Proceed as planned

### First Intervention Rule:
- **If "Sway" hits early** (tension rising, vision dropping): Get in water immediately
- Use hydrostatic pressure to assist kidneys
- Do NOT wait for code alerts if you feel symptoms

## Code vs. Life Support

**Cursor (Code):**
- Tracks data
- Provides alerts
- Calculates predictions
- Suggests actions

**User (Researcher):**
- Makes life support decisions
- Interprets symptoms
- Decides when to stop
- Seeks medical attention when needed

**The code cannot feel your body. You can. When code and body disagree, trust your body.**

## Emergency Contacts

**If you experience RED LIGHT conditions:**
1. STOP protocol immediately
2. Begin rehydration (if able)
3. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen
4. Do not resume protocol until cleared by medical professional (if applicable)
