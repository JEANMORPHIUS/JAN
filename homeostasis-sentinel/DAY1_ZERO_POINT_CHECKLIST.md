# Day 1 Zero-Point Checklist

**Use this checklist tomorrow morning before starting the protocol.**

---

## Pre-Start Preparations (Done Tonight)

- [ ] **Break Glass Insulin**: Fast-acting insulin ready and accessible
- [ ] **High-Glucose Recovery Source**: Honey or juice nearby (for critical low glucose)
- [ ] **Dashboard Ready**: Homeostasis Sentinel loaded and accessible
- [ ] **Obsidian Template**: DAY1_TEMPLATE.md ready for data entry

---

## Wake-Up Protocol (Zero-Point Baseline)

### Step 1: Don't Move - Inner Sight Baseline
- [ ] Check `vision_clarity` while STILL IN BED
- [ ] Record score (1-10 scale)
- [ ] This is your "Inner Sight" baseline - most critical data point

### Step 2: The Finger Prick
- [ ] Get blood glucose reading (finger prick)
- [ ] Record value (mg/dL)
- [ ] Record time

### Step 3: Initial Body Scan
- [ ] Assess `muscle_tension` (1-10)
- [ ] Assess `breath_quality` (1-10: 1=Acetone/Metallic, 10=Fresh)
- [ ] Note any physical sensations

### Step 4: Decision Point
- [ ] **IF Vision < 4 BEFORE first Loop** → **YELLOW LIGHT** (consider postponing)
- [ ] **IF Vision 4-6** → Proceed with extreme caution, increase monitoring frequency
- [ ] **IF Vision > 6** → Proceed as planned

---

## First Sun (Circadian Sync)

- [ ] Witness sunrise
- [ ] Record time of first sun observation
- [ ] This "sets" your Circadian Sync baseline
- [ ] Record `circadian_sync_score` (estimate 0-100)

---

## The First Loop

- [ ] Record time of first urine re-integration
- [ ] Record `loop_frequency` (1-10)
- [ ] Record `urine_color` (1-10: 1=Dark/Concentrated, 10=Clear/Dilute)

### Critical: 30-Minute Post-Loop Check
- [ ] **30 minutes after first Loop**: Check vision again
- [ ] **IF vision blurs within 30 minutes** → Loop is too "heavy" today
- [ ] **Action**: 2-hour Water-Only window before next loop
- [ ] **Monitor Velocity**: Track how fast vision changes

---

## Hourly Monitoring (First 4 Hours)

Track these metrics every hour:
- [ ] `vision_clarity` (1-10)
- [ ] `blood_glucose` (mg/dL) - if available
- [ ] `muscle_tension` (1-10)
- [ ] `breath_quality` (1-10)
- [ ] Calculate `vision_velocity` (change per hour)

**Red Flags:**
- [ ] Vision drops >1.5 points in 1 hour (Rapid Decline)
- [ ] Glucose <70 AND Vision declining (Velocity & Glycogen Paradox)
- [ ] Breath <3 AND Tension >8 (Current Acidosis)

---

## Mechanical Lever Calibration

### After First Swim/Sauna Session:
- [ ] Record activity type and duration
- [ ] Record `vision_clarity` BEFORE activity
- [ ] Record `muscle_tension` BEFORE activity

**60-Minute Post-Activity Check:**
- [ ] Record `vision_clarity` AFTER (60 minutes)
- [ ] Calculate improvement
- [ ] **Threshold**: 20 MIN SWIM must improve vision by +1.0 point
- [ ] **Threshold**: Sauna must improve vision by +0.5 points
- [ ] **IF threshold not met** → Mechanical Lever Failed
- [ ] **Action if failed**: Water Flush or medical intervention

---

## Emergency Protocols

### If "Break Glass" Triggers (Glucose >250 AND Vision <3):
- [ ] **STOP PROTOCOL**
- [ ] Have fast-acting insulin ready
- [ ] Loop theory failing physical reality
- [ ] Consider medical intervention

### If "Double-Down" Triggers (Glucose >180 AND Vision <4):
- [ ] **STOP LOOP**
- [ ] DRINK 1L ALKALINE WATER
- [ ] 20 MIN SWIM
- [ ] Monitor vision every 30 minutes

### If "Velocity & Glycogen Paradox" (Low Glucose + Declining Vision):
- [ ] Have honey/juice ready immediately
- [ ] Monitor every 15 minutes
- [ ] In zero-food state, "Low" can become "Crash" in minutes

### If "Current Acidosis" (Breath <3 AND Tension >8):
- [ ] This is CURRENT state, not prediction
- [ ] IMMEDIATE: Flush protocol + mechanical clearance
- [ ] Do not delay

---

## Daily Tracking Reminders

- [ ] Record all metrics in Obsidian markdown file
- [ ] Use DAY1_TEMPLATE.md structure
- [ ] Tag entries with #clarity #crises #stagnation as appropriate
- [ ] Note "Mental/Emotional Sway" observations
- [ ] Track cortisol impact (emotional stress → glucose spikes)

---

## End of Day Review

- [ ] Review all alerts triggered
- [ ] Assess velocity patterns
- [ ] Evaluate mechanical lever effectiveness
- [ ] Decide: Continue / Pause / Stop protocol
- [ ] Document key learnings for tomorrow

**Remember: You are the pilot and the mechanic. The dashboard provides the gauges. Trust your body. When in doubt, STOP.**

**Good luck on Day 1. Stay safe. Trust the Hard-Deck.**
