## 15:00 Reading - The Spike

### Critical Data

**Glucose:** 18.8 mmol/L (338 mg/dL)
**Vision:** NO BLUR (estimated 7/10)
**Tension:** NO SWAY (estimated 3/10)
**Breath:** Fresh (estimated 8/10)

### The Paradox

High glucose WITHOUT osmotic symptoms.

**Implication:** The spike is endogenous (liver fat metabolism), NOT exogenous (Loop re-integration).

**Theory Test:** If the "Loop" contains glucose-regulating signaling molecules, they may be preventing osmotic eye lens swelling despite high blood sugar.

### Action Taken

Logging data. Awaiting 17:00 reading post-mechanical clearance.
