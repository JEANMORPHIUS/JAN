# Day 1 Evening Checklist - Critical Monitoring

**Current Status:** 19:00 - Glucose 520 mg/dL, Muscle Cramps, Flush Protocol Started

---

## Immediate Actions (21:00 - After 2-Hour Flush)

- [ ] **Glucose Reading** (finger prick)
  - Expected: 400-450 mg/dL (if flush is working)
  - Concerning: Still >500 mg/dL
  - Critical: >600 mg/dL → Consider medical intervention

- [ ] **Muscle Cramps Check**
  - Improved? (flush working)
  - Same? (needs more time)
  - Worse? (escalating concern)

- [ ] **Vision Clarity** (1-10 scale)
  - Still clear? (osmotic protection holding for vision)
  - Starting to blur? (next symptom emerging)

- [ ] **Breath Quality Check**
  - Fresh? (no acidosis)
  - Sweet/Metallic? (early ketone sign)
  - Acetone smell? (concerning)

---

## Before Bed (23:00)

- [ ] **Final Glucose Reading**
  - Expected: 250-350 mg/dL (natural decline)
  - If >400: Consider small basal insulin
  - If >600: Medical intervention

- [ ] **Full Symptom Check**
  - Vision: /10
  - Muscle Tension/Cramps: /10
  - Breath Quality: /10
  - Nausea? (Yes/No)
  - Headache? (Yes/No)

- [ ] **Water Intake Total**
  - Aim: 2-2.5L total for evening
  - Continue sipping, not chugging

- [ ] **Loop Count Final**
  - Total voids for Day 1: ____ (currently at 6)
  - Any additional evening voids before bed

---

## Emergency Red Flags 🚨

**Call for Medical Help If:**
- Glucose >600 mg/dL AND not declining
- Ketones >1.0 mmol/L (re-test if possible)
- Vision blur + nausea + vomiting (DKA symptoms)
- Confusion, extreme fatigue, chest pain

**You're NOT there yet. Ketones 0.2 = safe. But monitor closely.**

---

## Tomorrow Morning (Day 2)

- [ ] **Fasted Glucose Reading** (before any Loop or food)
  - This shows overnight clearance rate
  - Expected: 150-250 mg/dL
  - If <100: Risk of rebound low
  - If >300: Slow clearance, adjust protocol

- [ ] **Baseline Symptoms** (before getting out of bed)
  - Vision: /10
  - Muscle Tension: /10
  - Breath Quality: /10

---

## Key Insight from Day 1

**Your Loop Protection Threshold: ~400-450 mg/dL**

- ✅ 338 mg/dL = NO symptoms (protection held)
- 🚨 520 mg/dL = Muscle cramps (threshold exceeded)

**This is VALUABLE data. You now know YOUR body's limit.**

---

## Dashboard Update

After tonight's readings, update `2026-01-14_DAY1.md` with:
- 21:00 glucose + symptoms
- 23:00 final reading
- Total water intake
- Final loop count
- How you feel

Then load into dashboard tomorrow to see full Day 1 visualization.

**Status: Monitoring Phase - You're doing great. Keep documenting.**
