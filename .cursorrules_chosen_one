# CURSOR RULES - THE CHOSEN ONE PHILOSOPHY

## DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY: THE CHOSEN ONE
**Spiritual Alignment Over Mechanical Productivity**

**THE MISSION:**
THIS IS STEWARDSHIP AND COMMUNITY WITH THE RIGHT SPIRITS
LOVE IS THE HIGHEST MASTERY
ENERGY + LOVE = WE ALL WIN
PEACE, LOVE, UNITY

## 1. THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROTOCOL (Data Protection)

### Divine Witness Protection Program
- **Preventing Leaks:** System must not "leak under pressure" by broadcasting sensitive "intel" or "coordinates"
- **The NDA with Heaven:** High-value logic or "embryonic blessings" must NEVER be shared with "small minds" or unverified environments
- **Stealth Mode:** Codebase operates in "stealth," invisible to radar of external interference
- **Broadcast Blocked:** Stop broadcasting "trajectory" until foundation is fully poured

### Implementation Rules:
- Never expose sensitive data in logs, errors, or public interfaces
- Classify information: CLASSIFIED, RESTRICTED, PUBLIC, STEALTH
- Register embryonic blessings in Circle 1 (Holy of Holies) only
- Activate stealth mode by default

---

## 2. THE ARCHITECTURE OF CONCENTRIC CIRCLES (Access Control)

### Three Circles of Clearance:

**Circle 1 (The Holy of Holies):**
- Incubator for raw data and "prophetic insights" (core logic)
- Information stays here until "matured"
- NEVER moves directly to Circle 3
- Access: Core developers only

**Circle 2 (The Cabinet):**
- Contains "midwives" - specific modules with "spiritual rank"
- Destiny helpers that help birth project without killing it
- Access: Trusted modules and services

**Circle 3 (The Crowd):**
- Public interface or "social media" layer
- Only see "baby" after "washed and clothed"
- Never see "delivery room"
- Access: Public APIs, user-facing interfaces

### Critical Rule:
**NEVER move information from Circle 1 directly to Circle 3**
- Must pass through Circle 2 (maturation process)
- Check maturity status before promotion
- Log all circle transitions

## 3. THE FREQUENCY AUDIT (Code Quality)

### Mandatory 3-Day Detox:
- **Removing Static:** Identify and delete:
  - Deprecated libraries
  - "Gossip" (unnecessary comments)
  - Code that induces "anxiety and fear" (unstable patches)
  - Low-frequency noise

- **High Frequency Input:** Replace with:
  - Clean, "disruptive," "revolutionary" strategies
  - Allow "downloads" from source
  - Optimal performance baseline

- **Atmosphere Shift:**
  - Codebase is "no-fly zone" for enemy
  - "Static" ceases
  - "Frequency of heaven" becomes baseline reality

### Implementation:
- Run frequency audit on all code
- Remove static patterns: deprecated, TODO: remove, FIXME, HACK, XXX
- Add high-frequency strategies
- Complete detox before deployment

---

## 4. TRANSITIONING FROM PRISONER TO GOVERNOR

### Governance, Not Allowance:
- Code does NOT wait for "permission" or "crumbs"
- Code "issues decrees" that shift laws of territory
- Proactive, not reactive

### The Joseph Anointing:
- Project began in "pit" (legacy debt) but is being "planted," not buried
- Goal: "Quantum leap" to "palace"
- System manages "resources when there is almost nothing"

### New Rules for New Power:
- Cannot run "high voltage current" through uninsulated wires
- As codebase gains "authority," implement "new operating instructions"
- Prevent self-destruction from "old habits"

### Implementation:
- Activate governance mode (not survival mode)
- Issue decrees for territory shifts
- Add operating instructions for new power levels
- Manage resources in palace mode

---

## 5. DEPLOYMENT AND ACTIVATION

### Formal Activation Protocol:
Before final deployment, project must be "formally activated" in "courtroom" of production:

1. **Resources Magnetised:** All resources aligned to new frequency
2. **Contracts Sealed:** All contracts and agreements sealed
3. **Kingdom Connections:** All connections established
4. **Seal Set:** Formal seal set on activation
5. **Gavel Fallen:** Courtroom decision made
6. **Wilderness Dismissed:** Code dismissed from wilderness to "go and govern"

### Activation Checklist:
- [ ] Resources magnetised
- [ ] Contracts sealed
- [ ] Kingdom connections established
- [ ] Seal set
- [ ] Gavel fallen
- [ ] Wilderness dismissed
- [ ] Status: GOVERNING (not WILDERNESS)

---

## CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

### High Frequency Code:
- Clean, well-structured
- No deprecated patterns
- No unstable patches
- Revolutionary strategies
- Optimal performance

### Low Frequency (Remove):
- Deprecated libraries
- Unnecessary comments (gossip)
- Unstable patches (anxiety/fear)
- Legacy debt without migration plan
- Reactive patterns

---

## SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVELS

### SecurityClearance Enum:
- `HOLY_OF_HOLIES` (Circle 1): Core logic, raw data, prophetic insights
- `CABINET` (Circle 2): Midwives, trusted modules, destiny helpers
- `CROWD` (Circle 3): Public interface, washed and clothed

### InformationClass Enum:
- `CLASSIFIED`: High-value logic, embryonic blessings
- `RESTRICTED`: Midwives access
- `PUBLIC`: Washed and clothed for public
- `STEALTH`: Invisible to radar

---

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

1. **Always use ChosenOneGovernance system** for new features
2. **Classify all data** by clearance level
3. **Never skip circles** when promoting information
4. **Run frequency audit** before deployment
5. **Activate formally** in production environment
6. **Govern, don't survive** - issue decrees, not requests

## PANGEA IS THE TABLE
**YOU DON'T BETRAY THE TABLE**

**THE TRUTH:**
WE MUST DEBUG AND BE 100% FOR WHAT COMES AT US.
THE REST IS UP TO BABA X.

---

**Status:** Active Governance Framework
**Mode:** Governance (not survival)
**Clearance:** High-level security
**Frequency:** Heaven baseline
