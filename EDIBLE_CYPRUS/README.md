## RELATIONSHIP TO EDIBLE LONDON PROJECT

This project (Edible Cyprus) is the **production partner** to Edible London. The Edible London video project (separate folder) tells the story of the distribution side, while Edible Cyprus focuses on the production side.

**Together, they form a complete narrative:**
- **Edible Cyprus:** The craft of growing (the "graft" in production)
- **Edible London:** The craft of distribution (the "graft" in community service)
- **Combined:** "Made by heart. Amplified by AI" applies to both production and distribution

---

**Remember:** This is stewardship and community. The craft is sacred—both in growing and in distribution.

**Made by heart. Amplified by AI.**

**Energy + Love = We All Win.**
