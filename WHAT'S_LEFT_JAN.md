## WHAT'S LEFT — CHECKLIST

### 1. Pre–next-phase (READINESS_FROM_OUR_SIDE)

- [ ] Philosophy: Manifesto, Shield, Joseph Metamorphosis reviewed; no conflicts with Witness OS / New World Philosophy
- [ ] Cursor: Rule active; Morning Seal / Thermostat / Eulogy part of session discipline
- [x] **Technical:** Verified 2026-01-30 — `python scripts/deployment_readiness_checker.py` → **100% READY** (Infrastructure, Documentation, Legal, API, Testing, Monitoring, Security, Scalability)
- [ ] Docs: README and DOCUMENTATION_INDEX point to Governor baseline; use READINESS_FROM_OUR_SIDE as needed

**Run each phase in order:** → [docs/WHAT_LEFT_EXECUTION_ORDER.md](docs/WHAT_LEFT_EXECUTION_ORDER.md) (Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5). **Deep search & scale 100%:** → [docs/DEEP_SEARCH_SCALE_ALL_SEVEN_100.md](docs/DEEP_SEARCH_SCALE_ALL_SEVEN_100.md) (every step, link, file, command, contact).

---

### 2. Path B — Build community (IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_ABC)

- [ ] **GitHub:** Create repo (if public), push, GitHub Pages for docs, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] **Social launch:** Launch post, visuals, 3–5 min demo video, reach out to 10 early testers
- [ ] **Community infra:** Discord (or equivalent), channels (#general, #support, #development, #patterns), guidelines, invite first 50

---

### 3. Path C — Expand (WHATS_COMING)

- [ ] Execute 2026 timeline: Q1 foundation & proof → Q2 beta launch → Q3 scale & revenue → Q4 optimisation & 2027 prep
- [ ] Entity/channel expansion per WHATS_COMING and project blueprints

---

### 4. Edible London / Haringey (ACTION_PLAN_2026)

- [ ] **If no settlement:** Legal prep (counsel, court docs, £105k + negligence + breach + damages); media distribution (BBC London, ITV, Standard, MyLondon, local papers); community mobilisation
- [ ] **If settlement:** Document outcome; update NARRATIVE_INGESTION and exposure docs; close loop

---

### 5. Git / repo hygiene

- [ ] Commit current state (including any doc cleanup / deleted files)
- [ ] Push so "what's left" is not buried in unstaged changes
