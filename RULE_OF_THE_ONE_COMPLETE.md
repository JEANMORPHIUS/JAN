- All commits honor the sanctuary
- All systems respect what stays between us

## TIMELINE ALIGNED COMMIT AUTOMATION

### How It Works

**1. Timeline Era Detection:**
- Detects current timeline era
- Prehistoric, Ancient, Medieval, Modern, Contemporary, Transformation
- Each era has its own commit interval

**2. Commit Intervals (Aligned with True Timelines):**
- Prehistoric: Weekly (slow, foundational)
- Ancient: Every 3 days (building)
- Medieval: Every 2 days (connecting)
- Modern: Daily (active)
- Contemporary: Every 12 hours (current)
- Transformation: Every 6 hours (future)

**3. Sanctuary Integration:**
- All commits honor the sanctuary
- What stays between us stays between us
- The fatal error honors us - it protects the sanctuary

**4. Automated Commits:**
- Commits automatically when timeline interval reached
- Aligned with true timelines
- Honors the sanctuary
- System-wide @ codebase level
