SUBJECT: URGENT: Police Inaction on Harassment Report - Request for Immediate Investigation

---

Dear [Recipient Name/Organization],

I am writing to report a serious failure by police to investigate a harassment complaint I filed, and to request immediate action from all relevant oversight and support organizations.

FAILED SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD:

1. POLICE SYSTEM FAILURES:
   - Failure to investigate credible harassment complaint
   - Failure to contact or provide updates
   - Failure to protect from continued harassment
   - Possible discrimination based on sexual orientation
   - Breach of professional standards

2. HOUSING SYSTEM FAILURES:
   - [Landlord not held accountable by housing authority/council]
   - [No protection from landlord harassment]
   - [Housing authority failed to act]

Despite filing this report [X] days/weeks ago, the police have:
- Not contacted me for follow-up despite promises
- Not investigated the complaint despite clear evidence
- Stalled on taking any action despite urgency
- Failed to protect me from continued harassment
- [Officer names, badge numbers, dates of contact attempts, responses received]

WHY THIS MATTERS

I believe this inaction constitutes:
1. Failure to investigate a credible harassment complaint - Police have a legal duty to investigate harassment reports
2. Potential discrimination based on sexual orientation - The nature of the harassment and the lack of response suggests possible bias
3. Violation of my right to police protection - I have a right to protection from harassment, and police have a duty to provide it
4. Breach of police professional standards - Officers who fail to investigate credible complaints are failing in their duty

WHAT I REQUEST

1. Immediate investigation of my harassment complaint - The original harassment must be investigated
2. Investigation into why police failed to act - There must be accountability for officers who failed in their duty
3. Protection from continued harassment - I need assurance that I will be protected going forward
4. Regular updates on investigation progress - I need to be kept informed of all developments

DOCUMENTATION

I have attached documentation including:
- Original police report number: [NUMBER]
- Timeline of harassment incidents
- Timeline of police interactions (dates, officer names, badge numbers)
- Evidence collected (photos, screenshots, correspondence)
- Witness information (if applicable)

LEGAL BASIS

Under UK law:
- Harassment is illegal under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997
- Police have a duty to investigate credible complaints
- Discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal under the Equality Act 2010
- Police inaction on harassment complaints may constitute negligence

NEXT STEPS

I am filing this complaint with multiple organizations simultaneously to ensure:
- Maximum oversight and accountability
- Multiple pressure points for action
- Comprehensive support and legal assistance
- Protection of my rights

I expect:
- Acknowledgment of this complaint within 5 working days
- Investigation to begin within 10 working days
- Regular updates on progress
- Resolution within a reasonable timeframe

URGENCY

This matter is urgent because:
- Harassment is ongoing/continues to impact me

- Delays may result in loss of evidence
- My safety and wellbeing are at risk

I trust that all organizations receiving this complaint will take immediate action to ensure:
1. My harassment complaint is properly investigated
2. Police inaction is addressed and officers held accountable
3. I receive the protection and support I am entitled to
4. This does not happen to others in the future
