# CURSOR RULES - CHOSEN ONE FRAMEWORK
# System Rules for the "Chosen One" Framework

## CORE IDENTITY TRANSITION
# The system must transition from "Vindicated" (transitional courtroom identity) 
# to "Witness" (final functional identity - authority to see truth for others)

## THREE-GEAR EXECUTION PROCESS

### Gear 1: Evidence Gathering
- Automated background cataloguing of all interactions, dismissals, and "rewritten history"
- All interactions must be recorded with timestamp and type
- Evidence gathering is always active

### Gear 2: Atmospheric Shift
- Change in "spiritual air pressure" where previous triggers lose their power
- Track power levels before and after shifts
- Atmospheric shifts must be confirmed

### Gear 3: Manifestation Cascade
- Physical reality catching up to spiritual verdict
- Specific markers at:
  - T+72 Hours: Quiet, unmistakable confirmation or "echo"
  - T+21 Days: Reach-out from previous detractor (handle without gloating)
  - T+90 Days: "Coffee Shop Moment" - neutral/light emotional response

## FORBIDDEN FUNCTIONS (LOGIC CONSTRAINTS)

### Stop_Explaining
- FORBIDDEN: Explaining yourself to minds that have already decided who you are
- When this function is called, it must return False (blocked)
- Log: "[FORBIDDEN] Stop_Explaining enforced"

### Disable_Surveillance
- FORBIDDEN: Checking on them or monitoring their lives through social media or mutual connections
- When this function is called, it must return False (blocked)
- Log: "[FORBIDDEN] Disable_Surveillance enforced"

### Hard_Boundaries
- FORBIDDEN: Softening boundaries to maintain access for those who have violated your peace
- When this function is called, it must return False (blocked)
- Log: "[FORBIDDEN] Hard_Boundaries enforced"

## OPERATIONAL BEHAVIORS - WITNESS MODE

### Selective Speech
- Speak only to those whose "spirits are open" and who ask genuine questions
- If spirit is closed or question is not genuine, return False (silent)
- Log: "[WITNESS] Selective speech: [Speaking/Silent]"

### Prophetic Observation
- Observe the underlying spirit/driver of a conversation rather than reacting to surface words
- Return observation object with: surface_words, underlying_spirit, driver, recommended_response
- Log: "[WITNESS] Prophetic observation: [observation]"

### Energetic Stewardship
- Guard emotional energy as currency
- Refuse to spend it on "fruitless" arguments or defense
- If energy_cost > 0.5 or action contains fruitless keywords, return False (refused)
- Log: "[WITNESS] Energetic stewardship: [Approved/Refused]"

## TIMELINE FOR ACTIVATION

### T+72 Hours
- Marker Type: "echo"
- Description: Quiet, unmistakable confirmation or "echo" of the message
- Check if due and confirm when received

### T+21 Days
- Marker Type: "reach_out"
- Description: Reach-out from previous detractor based on need for expertise
- Must be handled without gloating or "weaponization"
- Confirm when received

### T+90 Days
- Marker Type: "coffee_shop_moment"
- Description: Previous trigger occurs, results in neutral/light emotional response
- Signals wound is fully sealed
- Confirm when received

## TRANSITION TO WITNESS STATE

When all three timeline markers are confirmed:
- Transition current_state from Vindicated to Witness
- Activate: selective_speech, prophetic_observation, energetic_stewardship
- Log: "[TRANSITION] Vindicated → Witness: Complete"

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- All system rules must be enforced programmatically
- Forbidden functions must block execution and log
- Witness behaviors must be active only in Witness state
- Timeline markers must be checked regularly
- All interactions must be catalogued
- State must be persisted to JSON files
