## 📋 STANDARDIZATION RULES APPLIED

### 1. Lyrics Format Standardization

#### Section Markers
- **English:** `[INTRO]`, `[VERSE 1]`, `[VERSE 2]`, `[CHORUS]`, `[BRIDGE]`, `[OUTRO]`, etc.
- **Turkish:** Mapped to English equivalents:
  - `[KITA 1]` → `[VERSE 1]`
  - `[KITA 2]` → `[VERSE 2]`
  - `[NAKARAT]` → `[CHORUS]`
  - `[KÖPRÜ]` → `[BRIDGE]`
  - `[GİRİŞ]` → `[INTRO]`
  - `[ÇIKIŞ]` → `[OUTRO]`

#### Format Rules
- Consistent section naming
- Proper line breaks
- Direction/instruction lines preserved: `(like this)`
- Clean lyric lines (rhyme notation handled separately)

### 2. Suno Prompt Generation

#### CODED Framework Applied
All songs now have standardized Suno prompts using the CODED framework:

- **[CONTEXT]** - Setting and atmosphere
- **[OBJECTIVES]** - What the music should achieve
- **[DETAILS]** - Specific musical elements (instruments, vocals, mood, production)
- **[EXAMPLES]** - Style references (lo-fi soul, warmth, space, emotional truth)
- **[DIRECTION]** - Final guidance and constraints

#### Prompt Structure
```
Genre: [Genre from song metadata]
BPM: [Extracted from notes or default 85]
Key: [Extracted from notes or default D minor]

=== CODED FRAMEWORK ===

[CONTEXT] Karasahin (JK) studio, [mood] atmosphere, authentic emotional expression

[OBJECTIVES] Create music that serves The Table through truth-telling and emotional authenticity

[DETAILS] Instruments: [extracted list]. Vocals: [extracted style]. Mood: [extracted mood]. Production: crisp, clear, authentic

[EXAMPLES] Style: lo-fi soul over pristine digital, warmth over perfection, space over clutter, emotional truth over production polish

[DIRECTION] Avoid over-produced pop sheen, sterile digital sound, generic arrangements. Maintain authentic emotional core.

=== STRUCTURE ===
