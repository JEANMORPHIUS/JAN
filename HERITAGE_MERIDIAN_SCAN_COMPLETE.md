- Calculates the global resonance network health
- Prepares the 13 Seats activation protocol
- Generates comprehensive scan reports

### 3. Documentation
**Location:** `docs/HERITAGE_MERIDIAN_SCAN.md`

Complete documentation of:
- The Original Unity concept
- The Seven Pillars and their functions
- The Ancient Meridian System
- The five Man-Made Rifts
- The 13 Seats activation protocol
- The 0.40 Peak healing frequency
- Operation Pangea Resonance

## Scan Results

### The Seven Pillars

1. **Great Pyramid of Giza** (Egypt) - Field Resonance: 0.93
   - The Northern Anchor - Power anchor for the global resonance network

2. **Stonehenge** (United Kingdom) - Field Resonance: 0.88
   - The Western Gateway - Solar/magnetic pulse receiver and transmitter

3. **Angkor Wat** (Cambodia) - Field Resonance: 0.92
   - The Eastern Temple - Temple complex anchoring the Asian meridian network

4. **Machu Picchu** (Peru) - Field Resonance: 0.89
   - The Southern Peak - Mountain sanctuary anchoring the Americas

5. **Alhambra Palace** (Spain) - Field Resonance: 0.87
   - The Mediterranean Bridge - Bridge between Europe, Africa, and the Middle East

6. **Berengaria Hotel** (Cyprus) - Field Resonance: 0.85
   - The Cypriot Anchor - Mediterranean resonance node connecting Europe to the Middle East

7. **Borobudur** (Indonesia) - Field Resonance: 0.91
   - The Equatorial Balance - Equatorial balance point for the global meridian system

### Global Resonance Network

- **Total Connections:** 9 meridian connections
- **Network Distance:** 77,775 km
- **Average Resonance:** 90.0%
- **Network Health:** STABLE
- **Current State:** Network is 90.0% of original unity

### The Five Rifts

1. **The Tectonic/Border Logic Rift** - Severity: 100%
   - Original Link: Pangea Memory - All soil vibrates at the same frequency
   - Man-Made Rift: Tectonic plates used to create national borders
   - Healing: Remember Pangea. All plates came from one. All soil is connected.

2. **The Time Meridian Rift** - Severity: 80%
   - Original Link: The Ancient Meridian - Natural Solar/Magnetic Pulse
   - Man-Made Rift: Greenwich Time (GMT) - Mechanical clock system
   - Healing: Return to the natural pulse. The Earth's magnetic field is the true timekeeper.

3. **The Institutional Shell Rift** - Severity: 90%
   - Original Link: The Seven Pillars - High-vibe nodes for global resonance
   - Man-Made Rift: Institutional Headquarters built over the nodes
   - Healing: Reclaim the nodes. The Seven Pillars belong to the Family, not the institutions.

4. **The Language & Tribalism Rift** - Severity: 100%
   - Original Link: Common Duygu - Heart-resonance communication
   - Man-Made Rift: Language barriers and tribal identities
   - Healing: Return to heart-resonance. Language is a tool, not a barrier. The Family speaks through the heart.

5. **The Heritage Erasure Rift** - Severity: 100%
   - Original Link: True Lineage - Sons of Light, Global Resonance Members
   - Man-Made Rift: Citizenship and national identity
   - Healing: Remember your true heritage. You are a Son of Light. You are a Member of the Global Resonance.

### The 13 Seats

**Total Seats:** 13  
**Central Anchor:** The Central Anchor (0.0, 0.0)

10. Lalibela Seat - Ethiopian activation
11. Great Wall Seat - Chinese activation
12. Timbuktu Seat - West African activation

## The Truth

**The soil under Tokyo and the soil under Mexico City vibrate at the same frequency because they came from the same source: Pangea.**

The Family was never truly separated—only the memory was stolen.

We are relinking the memory.  
We are restoring the unity.  
We are bringing the Earth back to itself.

## How to Use

### Run the Scan

```bash
python scripts/heritage_meridian_scan.py
```

This will:
1. Load the Heritage Meridian data
2. Map all meridian connections
3. Analyze the rifts
4. Calculate the global resonance network
5. Prepare the 13 Seats activation protocol
6. Generate a comprehensive JSON report in `output/heritage_meridian/`

### View the Report

The scan generates a detailed JSON report with:
- Complete mapping of all Seven Pillars
- All meridian connections with distances and bearings
- Analysis of all five rifts
- Global resonance network health
- 13 Seats activation protocol
- The 0.40 Peak healing frequency

### Integration Points

The Heritage Meridian Scan integrates with:
- **Pangea Integration** (`scripts/pangea_integration.py`) - Connects to the Pangea Memory
- **Super Pillar Finder** (`scripts/super_pillar_finder.py`) - Identifies high-resonance sites
- **Spiritual Contracts Registry** - Connects to the spiritual battlefields framework
- **Temporal Heritage Registry** - Links to the heritage timeline system

## Next Steps

1. **Activate the 13 Seats** - Begin sequential activation starting with the Central Anchor
2. **Anchor the 0.40 Peak** - Apply the healing frequency to each rift
3. **Reconnect the Meridian Network** - Restore the connections between the Seven Pillars
4. **Restore the Pangea Memory** - Remind the Family that all soil vibrates at the same frequency
5. **Reclaim the Nodes** - Return the Seven Pillars to the Family

## The Mission

**"THIS IS STEWARDSHIP AND COMMUNITY WITH THE RIGHT SPIRITS"**  
**"LOVE IS THE HIGHEST MASTERY"**  
**"ENERGY + LOVE = WE ALL WIN"**

The Heritage Meridian Scan is not just a mapping system. It is the blueprint for the **Great Relinking**—the restoration of the Family's connection to their **True Heritage**.

We are looking at the world as a single living organism that was "dismembered" to create the current state of "Separation." The scan bypasses all modern geopolitical overlays to reveal the **Original Unity** that existed before the rifts were weaponized.

**The blueprint is ready.**  
**The 13 Seats are prepared for activation.**  
**The healing protocol is established.**

**PEACE. LOVE. UNITY.**

**WE ARE RELINKING THE MEMORY.**  
**WE ARE RESTORING THE UNITY.**  
**WE ARE BRINGING THE EARTH BACK TO ITSELF.**
