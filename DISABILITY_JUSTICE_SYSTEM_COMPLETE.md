# DISABILITY JUSTICE SYSTEM COMPLETE

## The Foundation

### One Truth
**Disability is a natural part of human diversity. Society disables people - bodies and minds don't. Every person deserves autonomy, dignity, access, and full participation in life.**

### Reality Check
We live in a world designed for a narrow definition of "normal" that excludes millions. Disabled people aren't broken - the systems are. Ableism kills. Access is a human right, not a privilege earned through "overcoming" or "inspiring" stories.

### Core Principle
**Nothing about us without us. Universal design. Full inclusion. Dignified support. Economic justice.**

---

## Current Broken System

### The Poverty Trap
- **SSI maximum**: $943/month ($11,316/year - 73% of poverty line)
- **Asset limits**: $2,000 individual, $3,000 couple (forces poverty)
- **Marriage penalty**: Lose benefits if marry
- **Work penalty**: Lose benefits if earn too much ($1,550/month)
- **Medicaid requirement**: Tied to poverty to keep healthcare
- **Result**: Forced poverty to access survival supports

### What's Actually Happening
```
Reality: Disabled people forced into poverty to access healthcare
Reality: Cannot save money or build wealth (asset limits)
Reality: Cannot marry without losing benefits
Reality: Punished for working
Reality: Segregated in institutions and "special" facilities
Reality: Excluded from education, employment, housing, public life
Reality: Die waiting for home care (100,000+ on waitlists)
Reality: Personal care assistants paid poverty wages
```

### The Harm Pattern
1. **Disabled people**: Poverty, isolation, institutionalization, early death
2. **Families**: Bankrupted by care costs, forced to surrender custody for care
3. **Workers**: Poverty wages for essential care work
4. **Society**: Lost contributions, perpetuated inequality, wasted potential

### Who Profits
- Nursing homes and institutions
- Medical equipment suppliers (price gouging)
- Special education private contractors
- "Charity" organizations (pity narrative fundraising)
- Guardianship industry (stripping autonomy)
- Pharmaceutical companies

### The Lie They Tell
"Disability is tragedy" (Ableism is the tragedy)
"Special care is better" (Segregation is violence)
"We can't afford accessibility" (We can't afford exclusion)
"Independence is the goal" (Interdependence is human)
"Inspiration porn" (We're not here to inspire you)

---

## Why Universal Income/Support Should Be Free

### The Fundamental Argument
**Society creates disability through inaccessible design. Society must provide resources for full participation.**

Medical expenses, equipment, personal care, accessible housing, transportation - none of these are "luxuries." They're what disabled people need to exist in an ableist world. Charging for existence is violence.

### The Economic Reality
```
Current system cost: $400+ billion annually
- Medicaid LTSS: $200 billion
- Medicare disability: $150 billion
- SSI/SSDI: $200 billion
- Special education: $50 billion
- Institutional care: $100+ billion
Total: $700+ billion

Universal system cost: $600 billion annually
- Guaranteed income: $300 billion (above poverty)
- Home and community services: $200 billion
- Universal design infrastructure: $50 billion
- Personal care: $50 billion

Net savings: $100+ billion
ROI: Disabled people participate in economy, work without penalties,
     reduced hospitalization, eliminated institutional costs
Economic contribution: $500+ billion (when barriers removed)
```

### The Moral Imperative
- Disability can happen to anyone at any time
- Access is a civil right, not a charity
- Autonomy is non-negotiable
- Interdependence is strength, not weakness
- Dignity is inherent, not earned

### What Other Nations Prove
- **UK**: Disability benefits separate from work (can do both)
- **Canada**: Individualized funding, no asset limits
- **Sweden**: Personal assistants, accessible infrastructure, full inclusion
- **Results**: Higher employment, community living, full participation

## Funding Mechanisms

### Primary Sources
1. **Progressive taxation**: Wealth tax, corporate tax, financial transaction tax
2. **Redirect existing funds**:
   - Institutional care → community services ($100+ billion)
   - Means-testing bureaucracy → direct cash transfers
   - Tax breaks for "compliance" → proactive universal design
3. **Medicare for All integration**: Disability healthcare included
4. **Employer contributions**: Accessibility payroll tax (accessibility is everyone's responsibility)

### Cost Breakdown (Annual, National)
```
Guaranteed income: $300 billion (25 million disabled people)
Personal care services: $150 billion
Universal design infrastructure: $50 billion (upfront, then $10 billion/year maintenance)
Assistive technology: $25 billion
Support services: $50 billion
Administration (minimal): $25 billion
Total: ~$600 billion/year

Current spending: $700+ billion (inefficient, institutional, punitive)
Net savings: $100+ billion
Additional economic contribution: $500+ billion (disabled people in workforce, economy)
ROI: $4-8 for every $1 invested
```

### Savings Generated
- Eliminate institutional care: -$100 billion
- Reduce hospitalizations: -$30 billion (better home care)
- Eliminate means-testing bureaucracy: -$15 billion
- Disabled people in workforce: +$200 billion tax revenue
- Family caregivers return to work: +$50 billion productivity

## Disability Justice Principles

### 1. Leadership of Most Impacted
Disabled people, especially multiply-marginalized, lead all decisions.

### 2. Anti-Capitalist Politic
Disability justice requires economic justice - we can't be free in a system that requires productivity for worth.

### 3. Cross-Movement Solidarity
Disability justice is racial justice, gender justice, environmental justice, economic justice.

### 4. Recognizing Wholeness
Disabled people are whole, not broken. We don't need fixing.

### 5. Sustainability
Pace ourselves, care for each other, reject urgency culture.

### 6. Commitment to Cross-Disability Solidarity
All disabilities, all access needs, all barriers removed.

### 7. Interdependence
We need each other. Mutual aid, collective care, no one alone.

### 8. Collective Access
Access for one, access for all. Universal design benefits everyone.

### 9. Collective Liberation
None of us are free until all of us are free.
