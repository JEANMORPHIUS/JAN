FAILED SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD:

1. POLICE SYSTEM FAILURES:

Despite filing this report [X] days/weeks ago, the police have:
- Not contacted me for follow-up despite promises to do so
- Not investigated the complaint despite clear evidence and credible allegations
- Stalled on taking any action despite the urgent nature and continued harassment
- Failed to protect me from continued harassment
- [Officer names, badge numbers, dates of all contact attempts, responses received or lack thereof]

WHY THIS MATTERS

I believe this inaction constitutes:
1. Failure to investigate a credible harassment complaint - Police have a legal duty to investigate harassment reports
2. Potential discrimination based on sexual orientation - The nature of the harassment and the lack of response suggests possible bias
3. Violation of my right to police protection - I have a right to protection from harassment, and police have a duty to provide it
4. Breach of police professional standards - Officers who fail to investigate credible complaints are failing in their duty

WHAT I REQUEST

1. Immediate investigation of my harassment complaint - The original harassment must be investigated
2. Investigation into why police failed to act - There must be accountability for officers who failed in their duty
3. Protection from continued harassment - I need assurance that I will be protected going forward
4. Regular updates on investigation progress - I need to be kept informed of all developments

FOR MY MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT

As my elected representative, I request your assistance in:
- Escalating this matter directly to police leadership
- Contacting the Police and Crime Commissioner on my behalf

- Timeline of harassment incidents

LEGAL BASIS

Under UK law:
