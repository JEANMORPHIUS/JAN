## THE STORY IN THREE LINES

1. **During the pandemic:** Edible London and 1,600 volunteers fed over 1 million people; Council publicly celebrated the effort.
2. **After:** £105,000 agreed debt unpaid; promised sites (St. Ann's, Riverside Road) never received Heads of Terms — over 3 years overdue.
3. **Now:** Formal notice sent; Subject Access Request filed (9 Jan 2026); we are seeking accountability and settlement.

## WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR

- **Financial:** £105,000 debt paid on a legally binding schedule.
- **Stay of enforcement:** Immediate stay on rent enforcement for 20/22 Bernard Road (Council breach caused inability to pay).
- **Legal frameworks:** Immediate issuance of Heads of Terms for St. Ann's and Riverside Road (promised Feb 2021; 3+ years overdue).
