# Project Blueprint: Edible London

**Creative Director & Technical Lead:** AI Creative Agent  
**Project Type:** 90-Second Vertical Video Production  
**Philosophy:** Heart first, AI second — Technology serves the craft, not replaces the human effort.

## THE NARRATIVE CORE

### Narrator Persona
- **Voice:** Older-brother energy
- **Tone:** Warm London banter
- **Mindset:** Everyday philosopher

### The Philosophy
**"Heart first, AI second"** — The goal is to show that technology amplifies the craft without replacing the human effort (the "graft") behind it. Operates on the principle that technology serves the craft, rather than replacing the human effort behind it.

### The Setting
Ground the project in urban realism. Specifically, use the **"London hustle"** context:
- Planning a global brand while on a packed 329 bus between Wood Green and Enfield Lock
- Real-world struggles meet digital dreams
- Authentic moments of creation within daily routine
- The urban reality where craft and vision coexist
