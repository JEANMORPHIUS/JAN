## PRESS RELEASE (body)

**For immediate release**

**[LOCATION], [DATE]** — During the pandemic, [NAME/JAN] and a team of 1,600 volunteers fed over **1 million people** through Edible London — delivering 22,800 hampers and 182,000 meals and supporting 8,600 shielded residents. The Council publicly celebrated the effort. Six years on, **£105,000** in agreed debt remains unpaid, promised sites have been withheld for over three years, and the volunteer who led the response is carrying the cost.

"We didn't ask for a parade. We asked to be paid what we were owed," said [NAME]. "They called us heroes, then they strangled us. The numbers don't lie: £105,000, 1 million people fed, 3+ years with no Heads of Terms on promised sites. We documented everything. We preserved evidence. Now we're asking for accountability."

**The numbers (undisputed):**
- £105,000 — Unpaid debt
- 1,000,000+ — People fed
- 8,600 — Shielded residents supported
- 1,600 — Volunteers
- 22,800 — Hampers delivered
- 182,000 — Meals
- 3+ years — Heads of Terms withheld (St. Ann's, Riverside Road)

A **Subject Access Request** was filed with the Council on 9 January 2026. Formal notice and legal preparation are underway. This press release is issued to invite scrutiny and to support other frontline groups who have faced similar extraction after being publicly celebrated.
