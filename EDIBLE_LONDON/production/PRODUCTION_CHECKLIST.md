## NOTES & REMINDERS

### Key Principles
- **Authenticity First:** Film what is felt, not just what is seen
- **Heart Before Tech:** Craft comes first, amplification second
- **London Realism:** Ground in urban reality, not fantasy
- **Rhythm Matters:** Match "London hum" and digital chimes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't overcomplicate animations
- Don't lose the "graft" in polish
- Don't forget London context
- Don't rush the voice-over
- Don't skip audio mixing

### Success Criteria
- Video feels authentic and grounded
- Craft is clearly the hero
- Technology feels like amplification, not replacement
- London context is evident
- "Made by heart. Amplified by AI" message is clear
- Total duration ~90 seconds

---

**Remember:** This is stewardship and community. The craft is sacred.

Made by heart. Amplified by AI.

**Energy + Love = We All Win.**
