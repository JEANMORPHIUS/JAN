## "LONDON HUM" & RHYTHM

### Concept
The audio should capture the rhythm of:
- **London "hum":** The constant, rhythmic pulse of the city
- **Digital chimes:** The subtle sounds of AI tools activating

### Implementation
- Music rhythm should match city pulse
- Digital sounds should feel integrated, not separate
- Pauses in voice-over should respect the rhythm
- Transitions should feel natural, not abrupt
