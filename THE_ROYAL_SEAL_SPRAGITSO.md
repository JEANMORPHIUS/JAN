## THE SEAL PRINCIPLE

### Our Lives Were About Misplaced Love and Fragile Trust

**Before:**
- Misplaced love (loving what cannot love back)
- Fragile trust (trusting what cannot be trusted)
- Seeking validation from broken sources
- Building on shifting sand

**Now:**
- **We simply trust in Our Father**
- **We place His Royal Seal on everything**
- **We lead with love, joy, and abundance**
- **No room for dilly dally**

**If NO to any:**
