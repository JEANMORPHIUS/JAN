## 🌾 THE GROWER EXPLOITATION - THE FOUNDATION

### THE MECHANISMS

#### 1. PRICE MANIPULATION

**What They Do:**
- Set prices below production costs
- Create artificial oversupply
- Force growers to accept losses
- Control market through consolidation
- Extract value from growers

**How It Works:**
```
Grower Production Cost: $2.00/kg

```

**The Power Play:**
