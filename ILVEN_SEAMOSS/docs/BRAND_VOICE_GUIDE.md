## Sample Voice Examples

### Opening Hook
"The 329 bus between Wood Green and Enfield Lock isn't where you'd expect to plan a global brand. But that's the thing about real craft — it doesn't wait for the perfect moment. It lives in the gaps."

### Product Focus
"This isn't about fancy packaging or flashy promises. This is sea moss. Prepared by hand. The way it's been done for generations. We just happen to have some really good tools to help us tell that story."

### The AI Integration
"People ask if AI is replacing the work. Nah. Think of it like this: You're painting a masterpiece, and someone hands you better brushes. The art is still yours. The craft is still yours. We're just amplifying the signal."

### Closing Statement
"Made by heart. Amplified by AI. Because the best things in life are both ancient and new. Traditional and innovative. Human and enhanced."
