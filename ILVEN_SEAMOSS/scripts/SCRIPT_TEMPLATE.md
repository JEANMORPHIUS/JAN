## EXAMPLE FORMAT

### INTRO (THE GRAFT) — 15 seconds

**VISUAL:** Medium close-up of narrator in workshop, handheld camera. Warm lighting, textured background. Hands visible working with sea moss.

**NARRATOR:** 
"The 329 bus between Wood Green and Enfield Lock isn't where you'd expect to plan a global brand. But that's the thing about real craft — it doesn't wait for the perfect moment. It lives in the gaps. In the hands. In the graft."

**AUDIO:** 
- Voice-over clear and warm
- Ambient workshop sounds (subtle)
- Lo-fi oceanic undertone begins

**TIMING:**
- 0:00-0:05 — Narrator speaks
- 0:05-0:15 — Transition to hands working
