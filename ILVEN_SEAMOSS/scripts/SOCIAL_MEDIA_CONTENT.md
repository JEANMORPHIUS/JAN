#### Hook 1: The Bus Story
"POV: You're building a global brand on the 329 bus between Wood Green and Enfield Lock 🚌

Real craft doesn't wait for perfect conditions. It lives in the gaps. In the hands. In the graft.

This is sea moss. Made by heart. Amplified by AI. 🌊✨"

#### Hook 2: The Graft
"When your side hustle is actually your whole heart 💚

Hand-prepared sea moss. Every batch. Every jar. The way it's been done for generations.

We just happen to have some really good tools to help us tell that story.

Made by heart. Amplified by AI. ✨"

#### Hook 3: AI Question
"People ask if AI is replacing the work. Nah.

Think of it like this: You're painting a masterpiece, and someone hands you better brushes.

The art is still yours. The craft is still yours.

We're just amplifying the signal. 🌊✨"

#### Hook 4: The Vision
"Local craft. Global reach.

From a workshop in London to kitchens in Paris, Lagos, Toronto, Istanbul.

This is bigger than sea moss. This is about connection.

Heart first. Always heart first. 💚"

#### Hook 5: The Philosophy
"Sea moss, but make it global 🌍

Real work. Real hands. Real effort.

Technology that serves the craft, not replaces it.

Made by heart. Amplified by AI. ✨"

"The 329 bus between Wood Green and Enfield Lock isn't where you'd expect to plan a global brand. But that's the thing about real craft — it doesn't wait for the perfect moment.

This is sea moss. Hand-prepared. Every batch. Every jar. The way it's been done for generations.

But here's where it gets interesting — we're planning the global launch... on the 329. Between stops. Because real work doesn't pause for perfect conditions.

People ask if AI is replacing the work. Nah. Think of it like this: You're painting a masterpiece, and someone hands you better brushes. The art is still yours. The craft is still yours. We're just amplifying the signal.

Local craft. Global reach. From a workshop in London to kitchens in Paris, Lagos, Toronto, Istanbul.

This is bigger than sea moss. This is about connection. About taking something real and letting it travel.

Made by heart. Amplified by AI. Because the best things in life are both ancient and new. Traditional and innovative. Human and enhanced.
