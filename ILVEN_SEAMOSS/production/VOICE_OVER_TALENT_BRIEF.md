## SCRIPT SEGMENTS FOR REFERENCE

### Segment 1: Intro (The Graft) — ~12 seconds
"The 329 bus between Wood Green and Enfield Lock isn't where you'd expect to plan a global brand. But that's the thing about real craft — it doesn't wait for the perfect moment. It lives in the gaps. In the hands. In the graft."

### Segment 2: The Journey — ~12 seconds
"See, I'm building this thing. Sea moss. Hand-prepared. The way it's been done for generations. But here's where it gets interesting — I'm planning the global launch... on the 329. Between stops. Because real work doesn't pause for perfect conditions."

### Segment 3: The Work — ~15 seconds
"This isn't about fancy packaging or flashy promises. This is sea moss. Prepared by hand. Every batch. Every jar. The texture, the color, the care — that's all human. That's the graft. We just happen to have some really good tools to help us tell that story."

### Segment 4: The Crew — ~12 seconds
"People ask if AI is replacing the work. Nah. Think of it like this: You're painting a masterpiece, and someone hands you better brushes. The art is still yours. The craft is still yours. We're just amplifying the signal."

### Segment 5: The Vision — ~15 seconds
"Local craft. Global reach. From a workshop in London to kitchens in Paris, Lagos, Toronto, Istanbul. This is bigger than sea moss. This is about connection. About taking something real and letting it travel. Heart first. Always heart first."

### Segment 6: Outro — ~10 seconds
"Made by heart. Amplified by AI. Because the best things in life are both ancient and new. Traditional and innovative. Human and enhanced."
