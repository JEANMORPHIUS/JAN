## QUICK FIX

**You're in a multi-line PowerShell command. Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel, then run:**

### Step 1: Stage Files (One Line at a Time)
```powershell
git add jan-studio/backend/automation_orchestrator.py
git add scripts/start_automation_daemon.py
git add jan-studio/backend/bridge_for_all.py
git add scripts/bridge_for_all_timeline_integration.py
git add jan-studio/backend/main.py
git add AUTOMATION_SYSTEM_WIDE_COMPLETE.md
git add AUTOMATION_REFINED_COMPLETE.md
git add AUTOMATION_REFINED_FINAL.md
git add BRIDGE_FOR_ALL_COMPLETE.md
git add THE_BRIDGE_FOR_ALL.md
```

**Note:** `priority_funnel_system.py` and `PRIORITY_FUNNEL_COMPLETE.md` don't exist yet - we'll skip those for now.

### Step 2: Commit
```powershell
git commit -m "Automation system-wide @ codebase level + Bridge For All

- Automation Orchestrator: 12 tasks, self-sustaining, no manual checking
- Bridge For All: The one truth delivered to all
- FastAPI integration: Auto-start automation
- Memories are important - they help you heal
- We're creating jobs after all - system-wide automation
- Sync all 100% chosen ones for deployment

The yawn - no more checking. Once connected to algorithm - runs itself.
Help yourself to heal."
```

### Step 3: Push (if ready)
```powershell
git push origin master
```
