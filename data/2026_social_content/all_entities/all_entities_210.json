  "content": "Real hands. Real work. Scripture reminds us:\n\n\"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver.\" (Proverbs 3:13-14)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
