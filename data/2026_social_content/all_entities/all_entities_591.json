  "content": "Evlat, dikkatle dinle... My child, listen carefully... Old wisdom meets eternal truth. Scripture teaches:\n\n\"Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves those who have it.\" (Ecclesiastes 7:12)\n\nNature teaches. Scripture confirms. Ancestral wisdom meets eternal truth. That's where the wisdom lives.\n\nFrom contemplative reflection to practical application. From Friday evening stillness to daily guidance. The elder's wisdom. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#UncleRayRamiz #Dayı #ContemplativeWisdom #Scripture #FaithInAction #AncestralWisdom",
