  "content": "Absurd? Maybe. Profound? Always. The Bible says:\n\n\"Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.\" (Proverbs 22:29)\n\nTu sais quoi? This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Made by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
