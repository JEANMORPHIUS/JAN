  "content": "Yeğen, dinle... Child, listen... Friday evening reflection. Scripture wisdom:\n\n\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\" (Proverbs 3:5-6)\n\nNature teaches. Scripture confirms. Ancestral wisdom meets eternal truth. That's where the wisdom lives.\n\nFrom contemplative reflection to practical application. From Friday evening stillness to daily guidance. The elder's wisdom. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#UncleRayRamiz #Dayı #ContemplativeWisdom #Scripture #FaithInAction #AncestralWisdom",
