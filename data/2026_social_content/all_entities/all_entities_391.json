  "content": "Traditional craft, timeless wisdom. Scripture teaches:\n\n\"Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.\" (Proverbs 13:20)\n\nThis is sea moss. Hand-prepared. Every batch. Every jar. The way it's been done for generations.\n\nBut here's the deeper truth: when craft meets faith, when hands meet heart, that's where real work lives.\n\nTraditional wisdom meets timeless Scripture. Ancient preparation meets eternal truth.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #SeaMoss #HandCrafted #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
