  "content": "Merde, c'est beautiful! Scripture says...\n\n\"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver.\" (Proverbs 3:13-14)\n\nÉcoute, mon frère: This isn't about perfection. It's about authenticity—chaotic, messy, real. That's where the magic lives.\n\nFrom absurdist comedy to profound truth. From French/English chaos to eternal Scripture. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nJe reviens, baby! Made by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#JeanMorphius #Bilingual #Absurdist #Scripture #FaithInAction #ChaosAndCraft",
