  "content": "Evlat, dikkatle dinle... My child, listen carefully... Old wisdom meets eternal truth. Scripture teaches:\n\n\"Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm.\" (Proverbs 13:20)\n\nNature teaches. Scripture confirms. Ancestral wisdom meets eternal truth. That's where the wisdom lives.\n\nFrom contemplative reflection to practical application. From Friday evening stillness to daily guidance. The elder's wisdom. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#UncleRayRamiz #Dayı #ContemplativeWisdom #Scripture #FaithInAction #AncestralWisdom",
