  "content": "From Wood Green to the world. Scripture teaches:\n\n\"Desire without knowledge is not good—how much more will hasty feet miss the way!\" (Proverbs 19:2)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
