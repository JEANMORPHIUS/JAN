  "content": "Real hands. Real work. Scripture reminds us:\n\n\"And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together.\" (Hebrews 10:24-25)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
