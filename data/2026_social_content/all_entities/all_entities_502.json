  "content": "From hand to jar, from heart to community. The Bible says:\n\n\"There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.\" (Ecclesiastes 3:1)\n\nThis is sea moss. Hand-prepared. Every batch. Every jar. The way it's been done for generations.\n\nBut here's the deeper truth: when craft meets faith, when hands meet heart, that's where real work lives.\n\nTraditional wisdom meets timeless Scripture. Ancient preparation meets eternal truth.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #SeaMoss #HandCrafted #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
