  "content": "Sea moss made by hand, guided by heart. The Word says:\n\n\"Blessed are those who find wisdom, those who gain understanding, for she is more profitable than silver.\" (Proverbs 3:13-14)\n\nThis is sea moss. Hand-prepared. Every batch. Every jar. The way it's been done for generations.\n\nBut here's the deeper truth: when craft meets faith, when hands meet heart, that's where real work lives.\n\nTraditional wisdom meets timeless Scripture. Ancient preparation meets eternal truth.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #SeaMoss #HandCrafted #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
