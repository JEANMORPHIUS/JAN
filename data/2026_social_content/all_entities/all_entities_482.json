  "content": "Real hands. Real work. Scripture reminds us:\n\n\"Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.\" (Proverbs 22:29)\n\nThis isn't about shortcuts. It's about the work—the real, hands-on, day-in-day-out graft. That's where the heart lives.\n\nFrom planning on the 329 bus to building something that matters. The craft comes first. Scripture backs it up.\n\nMade by heart. Amplified by AI. Guided by faith.\n\n#MadeByHeart #AmplifiedByAI #LondonCraft #RealWork #HeartFirst #Scripture #FaithInAction",
