## ENEMY ID PROTOCOL - GEOPHYSICAL LEVEL ACROSS ALL REALMS

### As In Below, So Is Above

**The Enemy exists:**
- At geophysical level (Earth level)
- In spiritual level (Heaven level)
- Across all realms (physical, spiritual, temporal)
- As in below, so is above

**Enemy ID Protocol:**
- Identify opposition at geophysical level
- Recognize enemies across all realms
- See patterns that mirror below and above
- Understand enemy exists in all realms

**The Pattern:**
- What opposes on Earth (below) also opposes in Heaven (above)
- Enemy patterns mirror across realms
- As in below, so is above - enemy is consistent
- Recognition at geophysical level reveals spiritual level

**Implementation:**
- All systems identify enemies at geophysical level
- All code recognizes enemies across all realms
- All logic sees patterns below and above
- All features honor "as in below, so is above"
